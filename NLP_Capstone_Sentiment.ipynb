              "'Budget 2012-2013 \\n\\nSpeech of \\n\\nPranab Mukherjee \\n\\nMinister of Finance \\n\\nMarch 16, 2012 \\n\\nMadam Speaker, \\n\\nI rise to present the Union Budget for 2012-13. \\n\\nFor the Indian economy, this was a year of recovery interrupted. When \\none year ago, I rose to present the Budget, the challenges were many, but there \\nwas a sense that the world economy was on the mend. The Budget was presented \\nin the first glimmer of hope. But reality turned out to be different. The sovereign \\ndebt crisis in the Euro zone intensified, political turmoil in Middle East injected \\nwidespread uncertainty, crude oil prices rose, an earthquake struck Japan and \\nthe overall gloom refused to lift. \\n\\n2. While I believe that there should be no room for complacency, nor any \\nexcuse for what happens in one\\x92s own country, we will be misled if we ignore \\nthe ground realities of the world. The global crisis has affected us. India\\x92s Gross \\nDomestic Product (GDP) is estimated to grow by 6.9 per cent in 2011-12, after \\nhaving grown at the rate of 8.4 per cent in each of the two preceding years. \\nThough we have been able to limit the adverse impact of this slowdown on our \\neconomy, this year\\x92s performance has been disappointing. But it is also a fact \\nthat in any cross-country comparison, India still remains among the front runners \\nin economic growth. \\n3. For the better part of the past two years, we had to battle near double-\\ndigit headline inflation. Our monetary and fiscal policy response during this \\nperiod was geared towards taming domestic inflationary pressures. A tight \\nmonetary policy impacted investment and consumption growth. The fiscal policy \\nhad to absorb expanded outlays on subsidies and duty reductions to limit the \\npass-through of higher fuel prices to consumers. As a result growth moderated \\nand the fiscal balance deteriorated. \\n4. But there is good news in the detail. With agriculture and services \\ncontinuing to perform well, India\\x92s slowdown can be attributed almost entirely \\nto weak industrial growth. While we do not have aggregate figures for the last \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n2 \\n\\nquarter of 2011-12, numerous indicators pertaining to this period suggest that \\nthe economy is now turning around. There are signs of recovery in coal, \\nfertilisers, cement and electricity sectors. These are core sectors that have an \\nimpact on the entire economy. Indian manufacturing appears to be on the cusp \\nof a revival. \\n\\n5. We are now at a juncture when it is necessary to take hard decisions. We \\nhave to improve our macroeconomic environment and strengthen domestic \\ngrowth drivers to sustain high growth in the medium term. We have to accelerate \\nthe pace of reforms and improve supply side management of the economy. \\n6. We are about to enter the first year of the Twelfth Five Year Plan which \\naims at \\x93faster, sustainable and more inclusive growth.\\x94 The Plan will be launched \\nwith the Budget proposals for 2012-13. In keeping with the stated priorities, I \\nhave identified five objectives that we must address effectively in the ensuing \\nfiscal year. These are: \\n\\x95 Focus on domestic demand driven growth recovery; \\n\\x95 Create conditions for rapid revival of high growth in private \\ninvestment; \\n\\x95 Address supply bottlenecks in agriculture, energy and transport \\nsectors, particularly in coal, power, national highways, railways \\nand civil aviation; \\n\\x95 Intervene decisively to address the problem of malnutrition \\nespecially in the 200 high-burden districts; and \\n\\x95 Expedite coordinated implementation of decisions being taken \\nto improve delivery systems, governance, and transparency; and \\naddress the problem of black money and corruption in public \\nlife. \\n7. Today, India has global responsibilities of a kind that it did not have \\nearlier. Our presence at the high table of global economic policy makers is a \\nmatter of some satisfaction. It, however, places new responsibilities on our \\nshoulders. If India can continue to build on its economic strength, it can be a \\nsource of stability for the world economy and provide a safe destination for \\nrestless global capital. \\n8. I know that mere words are not enough. What we need is a credible \\nroadmap backed by a set of implementable proposals to meet those objectives. \\nIn my attempt to do so, I have benefited from the able guidance of Hon\\x92ble \\nPrime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and strong support of the UPA Chairperson \\nSmt. Sonia Gandhi. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n3 \\n\\nI would now begin with a brief overview of the economy. \\n\\nOverview of the Economy \\n\\n9. Yesterday, I laid on the table of the House the Economic Survey \\n2011-12, which gives a detailed analysis of the economy over the past 12 months. \\nIndia\\x92s GDP is estimated to grow at 6.9 per cent in real terms in 2011-12. The \\ngrowth is estimated to be 2.5 per cent in agriculture, 3.9 per cent in industry and \\n9.4 per cent in services. There is a significant slowdown in comparison to the \\npreceding two years, primarily due to deceleration in industrial growth, more \\nspecifically in private investment. Rising cost of credit and weak domestic \\nbusiness sentiment, added to this decline. \\n10. The headline inflation remained high for most part of the year. It was \\nonly in December 2011 that it moderated to 8.3 per cent followed by 6.6 per cent \\nin January 2012. Monthly food inflation declined from 20.2 per cent in February \\n2010, to 9.4 per cent in March 2011 and turned negative in January 2012. Though \\nthe February 2012 inflation figure has gone up marginally, I expect the headline \\ninflation to moderate further in the next few months and remain stable thereafter. \\n11. India\\x92s inflation is largely structural, driven predominantly by agricultural \\nsupply constraints and global cost push. Evidence suggests that prolonged periods \\nof high food inflation tend to get generalised. Fortunately, steps taken to bridge \\ngaps in distribution, storage and marketing systems to strengthen food supply \\nchains have helped us in a more effective management of inflation and led to a \\ndecline in food inflation. \\n12. The developments in India\\x92s external trade in the first half of the current \\nyear were encouraging. During April-January 2011-12, exports grew by 23 per \\ncent to reach US Dollar 243 billion, while imports at US Dollar 391 billion \\nrecorded a growth of over 29 per cent. What is heartening is that India has \\nsuccessfully achieved diversification of export and import markets. The share of \\nAsia, including ASEAN, in total trade increased from 33.3 per cent in \\n2000-2001 to 57.3 per cent in the first half of 2011-12. This has helped us weather \\nthe impact of global crisis emanating from Europe and to a lesser extent from \\nUSA. \\n13. The current account deficit as a proportion of GDP for 2011-12 is likely \\nto be around 3.6 per cent. This, along with reduced net capital inflows in the \\nsecond and third quarters, put pressure on the exchange rate. \\n14. Taking a bird\\x92s eye view of the entire economy and keeping in mind the \\ndifficult global environment, I expect India\\x92s GDP growth in 2012-13 to be 7.6 \\nper cent, +/- 0.25 per cent. \\n15. I expect average inflation to be lower next year. I also expect the current \\naccount deficit to be smaller, aided by improvement in domestic financial savings. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n4 \\n\\nII. Growth \\nI now turn to growth and fiscal consolidation. \\n\\n16. Our fiscal balance has deteriorated in 2011-12 due to slippage in direct \\ntax revenue and increased subsidies. On both counts our underlying assumptions \\nat the time of Budget presentation last year were belied by subsequent \\ndevelopments. The profit margins came under pressure due to higher interest \\nrates and material costs. This impacted growth in corporate taxes. Further, as \\nagainst an assumption of US Dollar 90 a barrel, the average price of crude oil in \\n2011-12 is likely to exceed US Dollar 115. This has necessitated higher outlay \\non subsidies than projected. The continuing uncertainty in the global environment \\nmakes it necessary for us to strike a balance between fiscal consolidation and \\nstrengthening macroeconomic fundamentals to create adequate headroom to deal \\nwith future shocks. \\nFiscal Consolidation \\n\\nFRBM Act \\n\\n17. The implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management \\nAct, 2003 (FRBM Act) at Centre and the corresponding Acts at State level was \\nthe pivot in the successful consolidation of our fiscal balance prior to the global \\nfinancial crisis of 2008. The outbreak of the crisis coincided with the year when \\nthe mandated targets of 3 per cent fiscal deficit and elimination of revenue deficit \\nwere to be achieved. The Government had to deviate from these targets due to \\ninjection of fiscal stimulus at that time. Following my announcement in the last \\nBudget Speech, I am now introducing amendments to the FRBM Act as part of \\nFinance Bill, 2012. \\nExpenditure Reforms \\n\\n18. The fiscal targets for Centre under the amendments to the FRBM Act are \\nindicated in the Budget documents. Meanwhile, I would like to highlight two of \\nits features that are steps in the direction of expenditure reforms. First, the concept \\nof Effective Revenue Deficit, introduced in the last Budget, to address the \\nstructural imbalances in the revenue account, is being brought in as a fiscal \\nparameter. Effective Revenue Deficit is the difference between revenue deficit \\nand grants for creation of capital assets. Focusing on this will help in reducing \\nthe consumptive component of revenue deficit and create space for increased \\ncapital spending. \\n19. Second, a provision for \\x93Medium-term Expenditure Framework \\nStatement\\x94 is being introduced in the Act. This statement shall set forth a three-\\nyear rolling target for expenditure indicators. It would help in undertaking a denovo \\nexercise for allocating resources for prioritised schemes and weeding out \\nothers that have outlived their utility. This would provide greater certainty in \\nmulti-year budgeting framework. It would also encourage efficiencies in \\nexpenditure management. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n5 \\n\\n20. In implementing the Twelfth Plan, the recommendations made by the \\nExpert Committees to streamline and reduce the number of Centrally Sponsored \\nSchemes and to address Plan and non-Plan classification, would be kept in \\nview. The Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System would be expanded to \\nfacilitate better tracking and utilisation of funds released by the Central \\nGovernment. \\nSubsidies \\n\\n21. Fiscal consolidation calls for efforts both to raise the tax-GDP ratio and \\nto lower the expenditure. In this context, we need to take a close look at the \\ngrowth of our revenue expenditure, particularly on subsidies. The major subsidies \\nat the Centre are for food, fertilisers and petroleum products. Some subsidies at \\nthis juncture in our development are inevitable. But they become undesirable if \\nthey compromise the macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy, more so, \\nwhen they don\\x92t reach the intended beneficiaries. \\n22. The Government has decided that from 2012-13 subsidies related to food \\nand for administering the Food Security Act will be fully provided for. All other \\nsubsidies would be funded to the extent that they can be borne by the economy \\nwithout any adverse implications. It would be my endeavour to restrict the \\nexpenditure on Central subsidies to under 2 per cent of GDP in 2012-13. Over \\nthe next three years, it would be further brought down to 1.75 per cent of GDP. \\nSuch a step is needed to improve the quality of public spending. Our effort now \\nwill be directed towards better targeting and leakage proof delivery of the \\nsubsidies. \\n23. The recommendations of the task force headed by Shri Nandan Nilekani \\non IT strategy for direct transfer of subsidy have been accepted. Based on these \\nrecommendations, a mobile- based Fertiliser Management System (mFMS) has \\nbeen designed to provide end-to-end information on the movement of fertilisers \\nand subsidies, from the manufacturer to the retail level. This will be rolled out \\nnation-wide during 2012. Direct transfer of subsidy to the retailer, and eventually \\nto the farmer will be implemented in subsequent phases. This step will benefit \\n12 crore farmer families, while reducing expenditure on subsidies by curtailing \\nmisuse of fertilisers. \\n24. All the three public sector Oil Marketing Companies have launched LPG \\ntransparency portals to improve customer service and reduce leakage. A pilot \\nproject for selling LPG at market price and reimbursement of subsidy directly \\ninto the beneficiary\\x92s bank account is being conducted in Mysore. A similar pilot \\nproject on direct transfer of subsidy for kerosene into the bank accounts of \\nbeneficiaries has been initiated in Alwar district of Rajasthan. The Aadhaar \\nplatform has also been successfully used to validate PDS ration cards in \\nJharkhand. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n6 \\n\\n25. These pilot projects show that substantial economies in subsidy outgo \\ncan be achieved by the use of Aadhaar platform. It will be our endeavour to scale \\nup and roll out these Aadhaar enabled payments for various government schemes \\nin at least 50 selected districts within the next six months. \\nTax Reforms \\n\\n26. As Hon\\x92ble Members are aware, the Direct Taxes Code (DTC) Bill was \\nintroduced in Parliament in August 2010. It was our earnest desire to give effect \\nto DTC from April 1, 2012. However, we received the Report of the Parliamentary \\nStanding Committee on March 9, 2012. We will examine the report expeditiously \\nand take steps for the enactment of DTC at the earliest. \\n27. Similarly, the Constitution Amendment Bill, a preparatory step in the \\nimplementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) was introduced in Parliament \\nin March 2011 and is before the Parliamentary Standing Committee. As we await \\nrecommendations of the Committee, drafting of model legislation for Centre \\nand State GST in concert with States is under progress. \\n28. The structure of GST Network (GSTN) has been approved by the \\nEmpowered Committee of State Finance Ministers. GSTN will be set up as a \\nNational Information Utility and will become operational by August 2012. The \\nGSTN will implement common PAN-based registration, returns filing and \\npayments processing for all States on a shared platform. The use of PAN as a \\ncommon identifier in both direct and indirect taxes, will enhance transparency \\nand check tax evasion. I solicit the support of all my colleagues cutting across \\nparty lines for an early passage of these landmark legislations. \\nDisinvestment Policy \\n\\n29. The Government has further evolved its approach to divestment of Central \\nPublic Sector Enterprises (CPSEs). The CPSEs are being given a level playing \\nfield vis-a-vis the private sector with regard to practices like buy-backs and listing \\nat stock exchange. The treasury management options for CPSEs have also been \\nenhanced. This will help improve the returns on public assets, support transparent \\nenvironment for the divestment process, besides unlocking the value and resources \\nfor all stakeholders. \\n30. In 2011-12, as against a target of ` 40,000 crore, the Government will \\nraise about ` 14,000 crore from disinvestment. For 2012-13, I propose to raise \\n` 30,000 crore through disinvestment. Let me reiterate here that while we are \\ncommitted to enhancing people\\x92s ownership of CPSEs, at least 51 per cent \\nownership and management control will remain with the Government. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n7 \\n\\nStrengthening Investment Environment \\n\\n31. The domestic investment environment has suffered on multiple counts \\nin the past year. It is time to fast track policy decisions and ensure on-time \\nimplementation of major projects. \\nForeign Direct Investment \\n\\n32. Organised retail helps in reducing cost of intermediation due to economies \\nof scale, benefiting both consumers and producers. At present, FDI in single \\nbrand and in cash and carry wholesale trade is permitted to the extent of 100 per \\ncent. The decision in respect of allowing FDI in multi-brand retail trade up to 51 \\nper cent, subject to compliance with specified conditions, has been held in \\nabeyance. Efforts are on to arrive at a broad based consensus in consultation \\nwith the State Governments. \\nAdvance Pricing Agreement \\n\\n33. In a globalised economy with expanding cross-border production chains \\nand growing trade within entities of the same group, Advance Pricing Agreement \\n(APA) can significantly bring down tax litigation and provide tax certainty to \\nforeign investors. Though, the provision for APA has been included in the DTC \\nBill, 2010, I propose to bring forward its implementation by introducing it in the \\nFinance Bill, 2012. \\nFinancial Sector \\n\\n34. Reforms in the financial sector have been pursued with the objective of \\nmore efficient market intermediation between savers and investors. \\n35. To encourage flow of savings in financial instruments and improve the \\ndepth of domestic capital market, it is proposed to introduce a new scheme called \\nRajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme. The scheme would allow for income tax \\ndeduction of 50 per cent to new retail investors, who invest up to ` 50,000 directly \\nin equities and whose annual income is below ` 10 lakh. The scheme will have \\na lock-in period of 3 years. The details will be announced in due course. \\nCapital Markets \\n\\n36. During the year 2011-12, we took a series of steps to deepen the capital \\nmarket and encourage investment in infrastructure sector. These steps included \\nraising of FII investment limit in long-term infrastructure bonds, corporate bonds \\nand government securities. The limit on External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) \\nwas also raised and qualified foreign investors were allowed to invest in specified \\nIndian mutual funds and directly in equities. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n8 \\n\\n37. I now propose to take the next steps in deepening the reforms in Capital \\nmarket by: \\n\\x95 Allowing Qualified Foreign Investors (QFIs) to access Indian \\nCorporate Bond market; \\n\\x95 Simplifying the process of issuing Initial Public Offers (IPOs), \\nlowering their costs and helping companies reach more retail \\ninvestors in small towns. To achieve this, in addition to the existing \\nIPO process, I propose to make it mandatory for companies to issue \\nIPOs of ` 10 crore and above in electronic form through nationwide \\nbroker network of stock exchanges; \\n\\x95 Providing opportunities for wider shareholder participation in \\nimportant decisions of the companies through electronic voting \\nfacilities, besides existing process for shareholder voting, which \\nwould be made mandatory initially for top listed companies; \\nand \\n\\x95 Permitting two-way fungibility in Indian Depository Receipts \\nsubject to a ceiling with the objective of encouraging greater foreign \\nparticipation in Indian capital market. \\nLegislative Reforms \\n\\n38. We have received the recommendations of the Standing Committee on \\nFinance on \\x93The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill, \\n2011\\x94, \\x93The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2011\\x94 and \\x93The Insurance Laws \\n(Amendment) Bill, 2008\\x94. The official amendments to these Bills will be moved \\nin this session of the Parliament. \\n39. To take forward the process of financial sector legislative reforms, the \\nGovernment proposes to move the following Bills in the Budget Session of the \\nParliament: \\n\\x95 The Micro Finance Institutions (Development and Regulation) Bill, \\n2012; \\n\\x95 The National Housing Bank (Amendment) Bill, 2012; \\n\\x95 The Small Industries Development Bank of India (Amendment) \\nBill, 2012; \\n\\x95 National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development \\n(Amendment) Bill, 2012; \\n\\x95 Regional Rural Banks (Amendment) Bill, 2012; \\n\\x95 Indian Stamp (Amendment) Bill, 2012; and \\n\\x95 Public Debt Management Agency of India Bill, 2012. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n9 \\n\\n40. The Enforcement of Security Interest and Recovery of Debts Laws \\n(Amendment) Bill, 2011 has already been introduced in Parliament. \\nCapitalisation of Banks and Financial Holding Company \\n\\n41. The Government is committed to protect the financial health of Public \\nSector Banks and financial institutions. For the year 2012-13, I propose to provide \\n` 15,888 crore for capitalisation of Public Sector Banks, Regional Rural Banks \\nand other financial institutions including NABARD. The Government is also \\nexamining the possibility of creating a financial holding company which will \\nraise resources to meet the capital requirements of Public Sector Banks. \\n42. To bring banking payment structure at par with global standards, a \\ncomprehensive action plan has been prepared for implementation in 2012-13. A \\ncentral Know Your Customer (KYC) depository will be developed in 2012-13 to \\navoid multiplicity of registration and data upkeep. \\nPriority Sector Lending \\n\\n43. A committee set up by RBI to re-examine the existing classification and \\nsuggest revised guidelines on priority sector lending has submitted its report. \\nAfter stakeholder consultation, revised guidelines will be issued. \\nFinancial Inclusion \\n\\n44. In 2010-11, \\x93Swabhimaan\\x94 campaign was launched to extend banking \\nfacilities through Business Correspondents to habitations having population in \\nexcess of 2000. I am happy to announce that out of 73,000 identified habitations \\nthat were to be covered by March, 2012, about 70,000 habitations have been \\nprovided with banking facilities. With this, over 2.55 crore beneficiary accounts \\nwould have been operationalised. The remaining habitations are likely to be covered \\nby March 31, 2012. As a next step, Ultra Small Branches are being set up at these \\nhabitations, where the Business Correspondents would deal with cash transactions. \\n45. In 2012-13, I propose to extend the \\x93Swabhimaan\\x94 campaign to habitations \\nwith population of more than 1000 in North Eastern and hilly States and to other \\nhabitations which have crossed population of 2,000 as per Census 2011. \\nRegional Rural Banks \\n\\n46. Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) have played a crucial role in meeting the \\ncredit needs of rural areas. I am happy to inform that of the 82 RRBs in India, 81 \\nhave successfully migrated to Core Banking Solutions (CBS) and have also joined \\nthe National Electronic Fund Transfer system. \\n47. The Government had initiated the process of capitalisation of 40 \\nfinancially weak RRBs, which has been completed in respect of 12 RRBs by the \\nend of February, 2012. I propose to extend the scheme of capitalisation of weak \\nRRBs by another 2 years to enable all the States to contribute their share. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n10 \\n\\nIII. Infrastructure and Industrial Development \\nLet me now turn to infrastructure and industrial development. \\n\\n48. Lack of adequate infrastructure is a major constraint on our growth. The \\nstrategy we have followed so far is to increase investment in infrastructure through \\na combination of public investment and public private partnerships (PPP). During \\nthe Twelfth Plan period, infrastructure investment will go up to ` 50 lakh crore. \\nAbout half of this is expected to come from private sector. \\n49. Viability Gap Funding (VGF) under the Scheme for Support to PPP in \\ninfrastructure is an important instrument in attracting private investment into \\nthe sector. This year it has been decided to make irrigation (including dams, \\nchannels and embankments), terminal markets, common infrastructure in \\nagriculture markets, soil testing laboratories and capital investment in fertiliser \\nsector eligible for VGF under this scheme. Oil and Gas/LNG storage facilities \\nand oil and gas pipelines, fixed network for telecommunication and \\ntelecommunication towers will also be made eligible sectors for VGF. \\n50. The Government has approved guidelines for establishing joint venture \\ncompanies by defence Public Sector Undertakings in PPP mode. This will serve \\nthe dual purpose of achieving substantive self-reliance in the defence sector and \\nproduction of state-of-the-art defence goods. \\n51. I had announced the setting up of Infrastructure Debt Funds to tap the \\noverseas markets for long tenor pension and insurance funds. I am happy to \\ninform the House that the first Infrastructure Debt Fund with an initial size of \\n`8000 crore, has been launched earlier this month. \\n52. For the year 2011-12, tax-free bonds for ` 30,000 crore were announced \\nfor financing infrastructure projects. I propose to double it to raise `60,000 crore \\nin 2012-13. This includes `10,000 crore for NHAI, `10,000 crore for IRFC, \\n`10,000 crore for IIFCL, `5,000 crore for HUDCO, `5,000 crore for National \\nHousing Bank, `5,000 crore for SIDBI, `5,000 crore for ports and `10,000 crore \\nfor power sector. \\n53. A harmonised master list of infrastructure sector has been approved by \\nthe Government. This will help in removing ambiguity in the policy and regulatory \\ndomain and encourage investment in the infrastructure sector. \\n54. To ease access of credit to infrastructure projects, India Infrastructure \\nFinance Company Limited (IIFCL) has put in place a structure for credit \\nenhancement and take-out finance. A consortium for direct lending and grant of \\nin-principle approval to developers before the submission of bids for PPP projects \\nhas also been created. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n11 \\n\\nNational Manufacturing Policy \\n\\n55. The Government has announced a National Manufacturing Policy on \\nOctober 25, 2011 with the objective of raising, within a decade, the share of \\nmanufacturing in GDP to 25 per cent and creation of 10 crore jobs. The Policy \\nencourages the setting-up of National Investment and Manufacturing Zones \\n(NIMZs) across the country. \\n56. I will now address some issues that have impacted infrastructure and \\nindustrial activity in the past months. \\nPower and Coal \\n\\n57. In power generation, fuel supply constraints are affecting production \\nprospects. To address this concern, Coal India Limited (CIL) has been advised \\nto sign fuel supply agreements, with power plants that have entered into longterm \\nPower Purchase Agreements with DISCOMs and would get commissioned \\non or before March 31, 2015. An inter-ministerial group is being constituted to \\nundertake periodic review of the allocated coal mines and make recommendations \\non de-allocations, if so required. \\n58. I propose to allow External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to part finance \\nRupee debt of existing power projects. \\nTransport: Roads and Civil Aviation \\n\\n59. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways is set to achieve its \\ntarget of awarding projects covering a length of 7,300 km under NHDP during \\n2011-12. This would be 44 per cent higher than the best ever length of 5,082 km \\nawarded in 2010-11. Of the 44 projects awarded during 2011-12, 24 projects \\nhave fetched a premium. I propose to set a target of covering a length of 8,800 \\nkms under NHDP next year. The allocation of the Ministry has been enhanced \\nby 14 per cent to ` 25,360 crore in 2012-13. \\n60. To encourage public private partnerships in road construction projects, I \\npropose to allow ECB for capital expenditure on the maintenance and operations \\nof toll systems for roads and highways so long as they are a part of the original \\nproject. \\n61. The airline industry is facing financial crisis. The high operating cost of \\nthe sector is largely attributable to the cost of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF). To \\nreduce the cost of ATF, Government has permitted direct import of ATF by Indian \\nCarriers, as actual users. \\n62. To address the immediate financing concerns of the Civil Aviation sector, \\nI propose to permit ECB for working capital requirements of the airline industry \\nfor a period of one year, subject to a total ceiling of US Dollar 1 billion. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n12 \\n\\n63. A proposal to allow foreign airlines to participate up to 49 per cent in the \\nequity of an air transport undertaking engaged in operation of scheduled and \\nnon-scheduled air transport services is under active consideration of the \\nGovernment. \\nDelhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor \\n\\n64. The Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) is being developed on \\neither side along the alignment of the Western Dedicated Rail Freight Corridor. \\nThe project has made significant progress. In September 2011, Central assistance \\nof `18,500 crore spread over a period of 5 years has been approved. The Japanese \\nPrime Minister has announced US$ 4.5 billion as Japanese participation in DMIC \\nproject. \\nHousing sector \\n\\n65. In view of the shortage of housing for low income groups in major cities \\nand towns, I propose to: \\n\\x95 Allow ECB for low cost affordable housing projects; \\n\\x95 Set up Credit Guarantee Trust Fund to ensure better flow of \\ninstitutional credit for housing loans; \\n\\x95 Enhance provisions under Rural Housing Fund from ` 3000 crore \\nto ` 4000 crore; \\n\\x95 Extend the scheme of interest subvention of 1 per cent on housing \\nloan up to `15 lakh where the cost of the house does not exceed \\n`25 lakh for another year; and \\n\\x95 Enhance the limit of indirect finance under priority sector from \\n` 5 lakh to ` 10 lakh. \\nFertilisers \\n\\n66. To reduce India\\x92s import dependence in urea, Government has taken steps \\nto finalise pricing and investment policies for urea. It is expected that with the \\nimplementation of the investment policy, country will become self sufficient in \\nmanufacturing urea in the next five years. In case of the potassic-phosphatic \\n(P&K) fertiliser, use of single super phosphate (SSP) will be encouraged through \\ngreater extension work. This fertiliser is manufactured entirely in the domestic \\nsector. Enhanced production would bring down our dependence on imports in \\nthe P&K sector. \\nTextiles \\n\\n67. The Government has recently announced a financial package of ` 3,884 \\ncrore for waiver of loans of handloom weavers and their cooperative societies. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n13 \\n\\n68. In addition to 4 mega handloom clusters already operationalised, I am \\nnow happy to announce two more mega clusters, one to cover Prakasam and \\nGuntur districts in Andhra Pradesh and the other for Godda and neighbouring \\ndistricts in Jharkhand. I also propose to provide assistance in setting up of \\ndormitories for women workers in the 5 mega clusters relating to handloom, \\npower loom and leather sectors. \\n69. The Ministry of Textiles runs Weavers\\x92 Service Centres in different \\nparts of the country for providing technical support to poor handloom weavers. \\nI propose to set up three such Centres, one each in Mizoram, Nagaland and \\nJharkhand. I am also happy to announce ` 500 crore pilot scheme in the \\nTwelfth Plan for promotion and application of Geo-textiles in the North East \\nRegion. \\n70. To address the need of the local artisans and weavers, I propose to set up \\na powerloom mega cluster in Ichalkaranji in Maharashtra with a Budget allocation \\nof ` 70 crore. \\nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises \\n\\n71. In order to enhance availability of equity to MSME sector, I propose to \\nset up a ` 5,000 crore India Opportunities Venture Fund with SIDBI. \\n72. The Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the building blocks of \\nour economy. They rely primarily on loans from banks and informal sources to \\nraise capital. To enable these enterprises greater access to finance, two SME \\nexchanges have been launched in Mumbai recently. \\nPublic Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises \\n\\n73. With the objective of promoting market access of Micro and Small \\nEnterprises, Government has approved a policy which requires Ministries and \\nCPSEs to make a minimum of 20 per cent of their annual purchases from MSEs. \\nOf this, 4 per cent will be earmarked for procurement from MSEs owned by SC/ \\nST entrepreneurs. \\nIV. Agriculture \\nI now take up agriculture. \\n\\n74. Agriculture will continue to be a priority for the Government. The total \\nplan outlay for the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation is being increased \\nby 18 per cent from ` 17,123 crore in 2011-12 to ` 20,208 crore in 2012-13. \\n75. The outlay for Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) is being increased \\nfrom `7,860 crore in 2011-12 to ` 9,217 crore in 2012-13. I am happy to inform \\nthe House that the initiative of Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India \\n(BGREI) has resulted in a significant increase in production and productivity of \\npaddy. States in eastern India have reported additional paddy production of seven \\nmillion tonnes in Kharif 2011. I propose to increase the allocation for this scheme \\nfrom `400 crore in 2011-12 to `1000 crore in 2012-13. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n14 \\n\\n76. This year, under RKVY, I also propose to allocate `300 crore to Vidarbha \\nIntensified Irrigation Development Programme. This Scheme seeks to bring in \\nmore farming areas under protective irrigation. \\n77. The Government intends to merge the remaining activities into a set of \\nmissions to address the needs of agricultural development in the Twelfth Five \\nYear Plan. These Missions are: \\n(i) National Food Security Mission which aims to bridge the yield \\ngap in respect of paddy, wheat, pulses, millet and fodder. The \\nongoing Integrated Development of Pulses Villages, Promotion of \\nNutri-cereals and Accelerated Fodder Development Programme \\nwould now become a part of this Mission; \\n(ii) National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture including Micro \\nIrrigation is being taken up as a part of the National Action Plan \\non Climate Change. The Rainfed Area Development Programme \\nwill be merged with this; \\n(iii) National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm aims to increase \\nproduction and productivity of oil seeds and oil palm; \\n(iv) National Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology \\nfocuses on adoption of appropriate technologies by farmers for \\nimproving productivity and efficiency in farm operations; and \\n(v) National Horticulture Mission aims at horticulture diversification. \\nThis will also include the initiative on saffron. \\nNational Mission for Protein Supplement \\n\\n78. Mission for Protein Supplement is being strengthened. To improve \\nproductivity in the dairy sector, a `2,242 crore project is being launched with \\nWorld Bank assistance. To broaden the scope of production of fish to coastal \\naquaculture, apart from fresh water aquaculture, the outlay in 2012-13 is being \\nstepped up to `500 crore. Suitable allocations are also being made for poultry, \\npiggery and goat rearing. \\nAgriculture Credit \\n\\n79. Farmers need timely access to affordable credit. I propose to raise the \\ntarget for agricultural credit in 2012-13 to `5,75,000 crore. This represents an \\nincrease of ` 1,00,000 crore over the target for the current year. \\n80. The interest subvention scheme for providing short term crop loans to \\nfarmers at 7 per cent interest per annum will be continued in 2012-13. An \\nadditional subvention of 3 per cent will be available to prompt paying farmers. \\nIn addition, the same interest subvention on post harvest loans up to six months \\nagainst negotiable warehouse receipt will also be available. This will encourage \\nthe farmers to keep their produce in warehouses. \\n81. A Short term RRB Credit Refinance Fund is being set-up to enhance the \\ncapacity of Regional Rural Banks to disburse short term crop loans to the small \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n15 \\n\\nand marginal farmers. I propose to allocate ` 10,000 crore to NABARD for \\nrefinancing the RRBs through this fund. \\n\\n82. Kisan Credit Card (KCC) is an effective instrument for making \\nagricultural credit available to the farmers. KCC scheme will be modified to \\nmake KCC a smart card which could be used at ATMs. \\nAgricultural Research \\n\\n83. Food security and agricultural development in the coming decades would \\ndepend upon scientific and technological breakthroughs in raising productivity. \\nWe have to develop plant and seed varieties that yield more and can resist climate \\nchange. I propose to set aside a sum of ` 200 crore for incentivising research \\nwith rewards, both for institutions and the research team responsible for such \\nscientific breakthroughs. \\nIrrigation \\n\\n84. Unless we recognise water as a resource, the day is not far when water \\nstress will start threatening our agricultural production. Focus on micro irrigation \\nschemes to dovetail these with water harvesting schemes is necessary. To maximise \\nthe flow of benefits from investments in irrigation projects, structural changes in \\nAccelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) are being made. The allocation \\nfor AIBP in 2012-13 is being stepped up by 13 per cent to `14,242 crore. \\n85. To mobilise large resources to fund irrigation projects, a Government \\nowned Irrigation and Water Resource Finance Company is being operationalised. \\nThe Company would start its operations in 2012-13 by focusing on financing \\nsub-sectors like micro-irrigation, contract farming, waste water management and \\nsanitation. \\n86. A flood management project for Kandi sub-division of Murshidabad \\nDistrict has been approved by the Ganga Flood Control Commission at a cost \\nof ` 439 crore, to be taken up for funding under the Flood Management \\nProgramme. \\nNational Mission on Food Processing \\n\\n87. The food processing sector has been growing at an average rate of over 8 \\nper cent over the past 5 years. In order to have a better outreach and to provide \\nmore flexibility to suit local needs, it has been decided that a new centrally \\nsponsored scheme titled \\x93National Mission on Food Processing\\x94 would be started, \\nin cooperation with the State Governments in 2012-13. \\n88. The Government has taken steps to create additional foodgrain storage \\ncapacity in the country. Creation of 2 million tonnes of storage capacity in the \\nform of modern silos has already been approved. Nearly 15 million tonnes capacity \\nis being created under the Private Entrepreneur\\x92s Guarantee Scheme, of which 3 \\nmillion tonnes of storage capacity will be added by the end of 2011-12 and 5 \\nmillion would be added next year. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n16 \\n\\nV. Inclusion \\nLet me now take up proposals for inclusive development. \\n\\nScheduled Castes and Tribal Sub Plans \\n\\n89. From the year 2011-12, allocations are being made for Scheduled Castes \\nSub Plan (SCSP) and Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) under separate minor heads as part of \\nthe Plan allocations. In 2012-13, the allocation for SCSP is `37,113 crore which \\nrepresents an increase of 18 per cent over 2011-12. The allocation for TSP in \\n2012-13 is `21,710 crore representing an increase of 17.6 per cent over 2011-12. \\nFood Security \\n\\n90. Our Government has taken definite steps to create food security at the \\nhousehold level by making food a legal entitlement for all targeted people, \\nespecially for the poor and vulnerable segments of our population. The National \\nFood Security Bill, 2011 is before the Parliamentary Standing Committee. \\n91. To ensure that the objectives of the National Food Security Bill are \\neffectively realised, a Public Distribution System Network is being created using \\nthe Aadhaar platform. A National Information Utility for the computerisation of \\nPDS is being created. It will become operational by December 2012. \\nMulti-sectoral Nutrition Augmentation Programme \\n\\n92. Following the decision taken in the Prime Minister\\x92s National Council \\non India\\x92s Nutritional Challenges, a multi-sectoral programme to address maternal \\nand child malnutrition in selected 200 high burden districts is being rolled out \\nduring 2012-13. It will harness synergies across nutrition, sanitation, drinking \\nwater, primary health care, women education, food security and consumer \\nprotection schemes. \\n93. In this context, Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme \\nis being strengthened and re-structured. For 2012-13, an allocation of `15,850 \\ncrore has been made as against `10,000 crore in 2011-12. This amounts to an \\nincrease of over 58 per cent. \\n94. National Programme of Mid Day Meals in Schools has enhanced \\nenrolment, retention, attendance, and also helped in improving nutrition levels \\namong children. In 2012-13, I propose to allocate `11,937 crore for this scheme \\nas against `10,380 crore in 2011-12. \\n95. Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls, SABLA, \\nhas been introduced last year with a view to address the nutritional needs and \\nother educational and skill development initiatives for self development of \\nadolescent girls in the age group of 11 to 18 years. For 2012-13, an allocation of \\n`750 crore has been proposed for the scheme. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n17 \\n\\nRural Development and Panchayati Raj \\n\\n96. Along with water quality, poor sanitation is one of the factors contributing \\nto malnourishment. Hon\\x92ble Members will be happy to know that I propose to \\nincrease the budgetary allocation for rural drinking water and sanitation from \\n`11,000 crore in 2011-12 to `14,000 crore in 2012-13. This is an increase of \\nover 27 per cent. \\n97. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) has been a successful \\nprogramme. In 2012-13, I propose to raise the allocation by 20 per cent to this \\nscheme by providing `24,000 crore. It will accelerate connectivity in the States. \\n98. A major initiative has been proposed to strengthen Panchayats across the \\ncountry through the Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (RGPSA). \\nThis programme will expand on the existing schemes for Panchayat capacity \\nbuilding. \\n99. In my Budget Speech last year, I had referred to our focus on the \\ndevelopment of backward regions. We have decided to carry the Backward \\nRegions Grant Fund scheme into the Twelfth Plan with an enhanced allocation \\nof `12,040 crore in 2012-13, an increase of about 22 per cent over BE of \\n2011-12. This includes the State component which covers projects in backward \\nareas in Bihar, West Bengal and the Kalahandi-Bolangir-Koraput region of \\nOdisha, development projects for drought mitigation in the Bundelkhand region \\nand projects under the Integrated Action Plan to accelerate the pace of \\ndevelopment in selected tribal and backward districts. \\nRural Infrastructure Development Fund \\n\\n100. This year, I propose to enhance the allocation under Rural Infrastructure \\nDevelopment Fund (RIDF) to ` 20,000 crore. Further in view of the warehousing \\nshortage in the country, I propose to earmark an amount of ` 5,000 crore from \\nthe above allocation exclusively for creating warehousing facilities under RIDF. \\nEducation \\n\\n101. The Right to Education (RTE) Act is being implemented with effect from \\nApril 1, 2010 through the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). For 2012-13, I have \\nprovided `25,555 crore for RTE-SSA. This is an increase of 21.7 per cent over \\n2011-12. \\n102. In the Twelfth Plan, 6,000 schools have been proposed to be set up at \\nblock level as model schools to benchmark excellence. Of these, 2500 will be \\nset up under Public Private Partnership. \\n103. The Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) was launched in \\nMarch, 2009 to enhance access to quality secondary education. In 2012-13, \\nI have allocated `3,124 crore for RMSA which is nearly 29 per cent higher than \\nthe allocation in 2011-12. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n18 \\n\\n104. A scheme for education loans is being implemented by banks. To ensure \\nbetter flow of credit to deserving students, I propose to set up a Credit Guarantee \\nFund for this purpose. \\nHealth \\n\\n105. They say persistence pays. I am happy to inform Hon\\x92ble Members that \\nno new case of polio was reported in the last one year. By modernising existing \\nunits and setting up a new integrated vaccine unit near Chennai, the Government \\nwill achieve vaccine security and keep the pressure on disease eradication and \\nprevention. \\n106. National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) is being implemented through \\n\\x91Accredited Social Health Activist\\x92- \\x91ASHA\\x92. The scope of ASHA\\x92s activities is \\nbeing enlarged to include prevention of Iodine Deficiency Disorders, ensure 100 \\nper cent immunisation and better spacing of children. At the community level, a \\nmore active role is envisaged for ASHA as the convenor of the Village Health \\nand Sanitation Committee, as also to support the initiative on malnutrition. Since \\nASHAs receive activity-wise, performance-based payments, this will also enhance \\ntheir remuneration. I propose to increase the allocation to NRHM from `18,115 \\ncrore in 2011-12 to `20,822 crore in 2012-13. \\n107. National Urban Health Mission is being launched to encompass the \\nprimary healthcare needs of people in the urban areas. The Pradhan Mantri \\nSwasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) aimed at setting up of AIIMS-like \\ninstitutions and upgradation of existing Government medical colleges is being \\nexpanded to cover upgradation of 7 more Government medical colleges. It will \\nenhance the availability of affordable tertiary health care. \\nEmployment and Skill Development \\n\\n108. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme \\n(MGNREGS) has had a positive impact on livelihood security. For the first time, \\nthere is an effective floor wage rate for rural workers. Distress migration has \\ncome down. Community assets have been created. Productivity of barren and \\nfallow lands has gone up. The need for improving quality of assets and bringing \\nabout greater synergy between MG-NREGA and agriculture and allied rural \\nlivelihoods is being addressed. \\n109. The Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) has been restructured \\ninto National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) to provide self-employment \\nopportunities. A sub-component, Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana, under \\nNRLM seeks to provide better targeting of women farmers. For NRLM, I propose \\nto increase the allocation by over 34 per cent from `2,914 crore in 2011-12 to \\n`3,915 crore in 2012-13. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n19 \\n\\n110. In last year\\x92s Budget I had announced creation of a \\x91Women\\x92s SHG\\x92s \\nDevelopment Fund\\x92. This has been set up in NABARD. In 2012-13, I propose to \\nprovide ` 200 crore to enlarge the corpus to ` 300 crore. This Fund will also \\nsupport the objectives of Aajeevika i.e. the National Rural Livelihood Mission. \\nIt will empower women SHGs to access bank credit. I propose to provide interest \\nsubvention to Women SHGs to avail loans up to `3 lakh at 7 per cent per annum. \\nWomen SHGs that repay loans in time will get additional 3 per cent subvention, \\nreducing the effective rate to 4 per cent. The initiative, in the first phase, would \\nfocus on selected 600 Blocks of 150 districts, including the Left Wing Extremism \\naffected districts. \\n111. It is proposed to establish a Bharat Livelihoods Foundation of India \\nthrough Aajeevika. The Foundation would support and scale up civil society \\ninitiatives and interventions particularly in the tribal regions covering around \\n170 districts. Private trusts and philanthropic organisations would be encouraged \\nto partner with the autonomous body that will be managed professionally. \\n112. To encourage micro enterprises, a credit linked subsidy programme \\nnamely Prime Minister\\x92s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) is being \\nimplemented through KVIC. The allocation for this programme has been \\nincreased by 23 per cent from `1,037 crore in 2011-12 to `1,276 crore in \\n2012-13. \\nSkill Development \\n\\n113. In 2011-12 National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) approved \\n26 new projects, thereby doubling the number of projects sanctioned since 2009 \\nto 52, with a total funding commitment of ` 1,205 crore. At the end of 10 years, \\nthese projects are expected to train 6.2 crore persons and augment vocational \\ntraining capacity by 1.25 crore per year in the private sector. \\n114. The NSDC partners have opened 496 permanent and 2429 mobile centres \\nin 220 districts across 24 states. More than 89,500 persons have been trained \\nand almost 80 per cent employed. Under NSDC, 10 Sector Skill Councils have \\nbeen sanctioned. Of these, 3 Skill Councils for Automobile, Security and Retail \\nsectors have become operational. For 2012-13, I propose to allocate ` 1000 crore \\nto National Skill Development Fund (NSDF). \\n115. In order to improve the flow of institutional credit for skill development, \\nI propose to set up separate Credit Guarantee Fund. This will benefit youth in \\nacquiring market oriented skills. \\n116. A new scheme titled \\x93Himayat\\x94 was introduced in Jammu and Kashmir \\nfrom 2011-12. It aims to provide skill training to one lakh youth in the next five \\nyears. The entire cost of this programme is being borne by the Centre. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n20 \\n\\nSocial security and the needs of weaker sections \\n\\n117. I am raising the allocation under the National Social Assistance \\nProgramme (NSAP) by 37 per cent from ` 6,158 crore in 2011-12 to ` 8,447 \\ncrore in 2012-13. Under the ongoing Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension \\nScheme and Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme for BPL \\nbeneficiaries, the monthly pension amount per person is being raised from ` 200 \\nto ` 300. \\n118. On the death of the primary breadwinner of a BPL family, in the age \\ngroup 18 to 64 years, a lumpsum grant of `10,000 is presently provided under \\nthe National Family Benefit scheme. I propose to double this amount to ` 20,000 \\nand expect a matching contribution by the State Governments. \\n119. In order to promote voluntary savings towards pensions, a co-contributory \\nscheme SWAVALAMBAN was started in September, 2010. Over 5 lakh \\nsubscribers have been enrolled by February 2012. In order to enhance access to \\nthis scheme, LIC has been appointed as an Aggregator and all Public Sector \\nBanks have also been appointed as Points of Presence (PoP) and Aggregators. \\nInstitutions that are being given grants \\n\\n120. The driving force of a modern nation is research and the creation of new \\nknowledge. With this in mind I propose to provide: \\n\\x95 ` 25 crore to the Institute of Rural Management, Anand; \\n\\x95 ` 50 crore to establish a world-class centre for water quality with \\nfocus on arsenic contamination in Kolkata; \\n\\x95 ` 100 crore to Kerala Agricultural University; \\n\\x95 ` 50 crore for University of Agricultural Sciences Dharwad, \\nKarnataka; \\n\\x95 ` 50 crore to Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural \\nUniversity, Hissar; \\n\\x95 ` 50 crore to Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology; \\n\\x95 ` 100 crore to Acharya N. G. Ranga Agricultural University in \\nHyderabad; \\n\\x95 ` 15 crore to National Council for Applied Economic Research; \\n\\x95 ` 10 crore to Rajiv Gandhi University, Department of Economics, \\nItanagar; and \\n\\x95 ` 10 crore to Siddharth Vihar Trust Gulbarga, to establish a Pali \\nlanguage Research Centre. \\nSecurity \\n\\n121. In the Budget for 2012-13, a provision of ` 1,93,407 crore has been made \\nfor Defence Services which include `79,579 crore for capital expenditure. As \\nalways, this allocation is based on present needs and any further requirement \\nwould be met. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n21 \\n\\n122. Government is making efforts to increase the availability of residential \\nquarters to forces. In 2012-13, it is envisaged to construct nearly 4,000 residential \\nquarters for Central Armed Police Forces for which ` 1,185 crore is proposed to \\nbe allocated. A provision of ` 3,280 crore for 2012-13 has also been made for \\nconstruction of office buildings including land acquisition and barracks to \\naccommodate 27,000 personnel. \\n123. The scheme to create the National Population Register (NPR) is \\nprogressing well. It is likely to be completed within the next two years. The \\nGovernment is also considering a proposal of issuing Resident Identity Cards \\nbearing the Aadhaar numbers to all residents who are of age 18 years and above \\nto help in the e-governance initiatives. \\nVI. Governance \\nI now address some concerns in governance. \\n\\nUID-Aadhaar \\n\\n124. The enrolments into the Aadhaar system have crossed 20 crore and the \\nAadhaar numbers generated upto date have crossed 14 crore. I propose to allocate \\nadequate funds to complete another 40 crore enrolments starting from \\nApril 1, 2012. The Aadhaar platform is now ready to support the payments of \\nMG-NREGA; old age, widow and disability pensions; and scholarships directly \\nto the beneficiary accounts in selected areas. \\nBlack Money \\n\\n125. Last year I had outlined a five pronged strategy to tackle the malaise of \\ngeneration and circulation of black money and its illegitimate transfer outside \\nIndia. Government has taken a number of proactive steps to implement this \\nstrategy. As a result: \\n\\x95 82 Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) and 17 Tax \\nInformation Exchange Agreements (TIEA) have been finalised and \\ninformation regarding bank accounts and assets held by Indians \\nabroad has started flowing in. In some cases prosecution will be \\ninitiated; \\n\\x95 Dedicated exchange of information cell for speedy exchange of \\ntax information with treaty countries is fully functional in CBDT; \\n\\x95 India became the 33rd signatory of the Multilateral Convention on \\nMutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters; and \\n\\x95 Directorate of Income Tax Criminal Investigation has been \\nestablished in CBDT. \\n126. I propose to lay on the table of the House a white paper on Black Money \\nin the current session of Parliament. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n22 \\n\\nPublic Procurement Legislation \\n\\n127. Government is committed to the enactment of a Public Procurement \\nlegislation to enhance confidence in public procurement and to ensure \\ntransparency and efficiency in the process. The Bill in this regard is to be \\nintroduced in the Budget session of the Parliament. \\n128. The following legislative measures for strengthening anti-corruption \\nframework are in various stages of enactment: \\n\\x95 Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Bill, 2011 \\nintroduced in Parliament with a view to bring certain provisions of \\nthe Act in line with global standards; \\n\\x95 Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Bill, 2011 is currently being \\nexamined by the Standing Committee on Finance. It would replace \\nthe \\x91Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988\\x92; and \\n\\x95 National Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Amendment) Bill, \\n2011 introduced in Parliament with a view to strengthen legal \\nprovisions for implementation of the national policy on Narcotic \\nDrugs and Psychotropic Substances. \\nVII. Budget Estimates 2012-13 \\nI now turn to the Budget Estimates for 2012-13. \\n\\n129. The Gross Tax Receipts are estimated at ` 10,77,612 crore which is an \\nincrease of 15.6 per cent over the Budget Estimates and 19.5 per cent over the \\nRevised Estimates for 2011-12. As a percentage of GDP, gross taxes are estimated \\nat 10.6 per cent in BE 2012-13 as against 10.4 per cent in BE 2011-12. After \\ndevolution to States, the net tax to Centre in 2012-13 is estimated at ` 7,71,071 \\ncrore. The Non Tax Revenue Receipts for 2012-13 are estimated at ` 1,64,614 \\ncrore and Non-debt Capital Receipts at ` 41,650 crore. The temporary arrangement \\nto use disinvestment proceeds for capital expenditure in social sector schemes is \\nbeing extended for one more year to 2012-13. \\n130. The total expenditure for 2012-13 is budgeted at ` 14,90,925 crore. Of \\nthis, the Plan Expenditure for 2012-13 is ` 5,21,025 crore, which is 18 per cent \\nhigher than the Budget Estimates of 2011-12. This is higher than the 15 per cent \\nincrease projected in the Approach to the Twelfth Plan for 2012-13. I am happy \\nto inform the Hon\\x92ble Members that in the Eleventh Plan, we have been able to \\nmeet 99 per cent of the total plan outlay. \\n131. The Non Plan Expenditure for 2012-13 is budgeted at ` 9,69,900 crore \\nwhich is 8.7 per cent higher than the Revised Estimates for 2011-12 and 18.8 \\nper cent higher than the Budget Estimates for 2011-12. This increase is mainly \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n23 \\n\\non account of higher provision for major subsidies. While making adequate \\nprovisions for funding the desirable subsidies, as indicated earlier, I am \\ndetermined to contain the increasing subsidy burden through measures including \\nimproved targeting. \\n\\n132. The Plan and Non Plan resources transferred to States and Union \\nTerritories including direct transfers to State and district level implementing \\nagencies are ` 3,65,216 crore in BE 2012-13. This includes ` 18,655 crore of \\ngrant to local bodies as per the recommendations of Thirteenth Finance \\nCommission. \\n133. The year 2011-12 was one of challenges for fiscal management. Due to \\nthe slower economic growth, direct tax collection fell short by ` 32,000 crore of \\nthe Budget Estimates. At the same time, the Government absorbed duty reduction \\nin petroleum sector with annual revenue loss of ` 49,000 crore. The Government \\nhad to incur higher expenditure on petroleum and fertiliser subsidy to insulate \\nthe people from the rising prices. While the outgo on account of subsidies \\nincreased, I have ensured that the entire amount is given in cash and not as bonds \\nin lieu of subsidies. This is in line with the approach that I outlined in my Budget \\nSpeech for 2010-11. \\n134. The combined effect of lower tax and disinvestment receipts and higher \\nexpenditure, mainly on account of subsidies, has pushed the fiscal deficit to 5.9 \\nper cent of GDP in the Revised Estimates for 2011-12. However, I have made a \\ndetermined attempt to come back to the path of fiscal consolidation in the Budget \\nfor 2012-13 by pegging the fiscal deficit at ` 5,13,590 crore which is 5.1 per cent \\nof GDP. After taking into account other items of financing, the net market \\nborrowings through dated securities to finance this deficit is ` 4.79 lakh crore. \\nWith this, the total Debt stock at the end of 2012-13 would work out at 45.5 per \\ncent of GDP as compared to the Thirteenth Finance Commission target of 50.5 \\nper cent of GDP. The Effective Revenue Deficit in BE 2012-13 works out to \\n` 1,85,752 crore which is 1.8 per cent of GDP. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n24 \\n\\nPart B \\n\\nVIII. Tax Proposals \\nMadam Speaker, \\n\\nI now come to Part B of my proposals. \\n\\n135. The life of a Finance Minister is not easy. Various players, including \\npolicy makers, politicians, agriculturists and business houses, participate in the \\nmaking of the economy. When everything goes well with the economy, we all \\nshare in the joy. However, when things go wrong, it is the Finance Minister who \\nis called upon to administer the medicine. Economic policy, as in medical \\ntreatment, often requires us to do something, which, in the short run, may be \\npainful, but is good for us in the long run. As Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark, \\nhad said in Shakespeare\\x92s immortal words, \\x93I must be cruel only to be kind.\\x94 \\nWith this reminder, let me now turn to the tax proposals. \\n\\n136. Last year, I had set the compass for movement towards the DTC in Direct \\nTaxes and GST in Indirect Taxes. My tax proposals for fiscal year 2012-13 mark \\nfurther progress in that direction. \\nDirect Taxes \\n\\nI shall now deal with direct taxes. \\n\\n137. Last year I provided relief to individual taxpayers by enhancing the \\nexemption limit as a move towards DTC rates. Although DTC will not be \\neffective from this year, I propose to introduce the DTC rates for personal income \\ntax. I propose to enhance the exemption limit for the general category of \\nindividual taxpayers from `1,80,000 to `2,00,000. This measure will provide \\ntax relief upto `2,000 to every taxpayer of this category. I also propose to raise \\nthe upper limit of the 20 per cent tax slab from `8 lakh to `10 lakh. The proposed \\npersonal income tax slabs are: \\nIncome upto `2 lakh Nil \\nIncome above `2 lakh and upto `5 lakh 10 per cent \\nIncome above `5 lakh and upto `10 lakh 20 per cent \\nIncome above `10 lakh 30 per cent \\n\\nThese changes will provide substantial relief to taxpayers. \\n\\n138. I propose to allow individual taxpayers, a deduction of upto `10,000 \\nfor interest from savings bank accounts. This would help a large number of \\nsmall taxpayers with salary incomes upto `5 lakh and interest from savings \\nbank accounts up to ` 10,000, as they would not be required to file income tax \\nreturns. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n25 \\n\\n139. Within the existing limit for deduction allowed for health insurance, \\nI propose to allow a deduction of upto `5,000 for preventive health check-up. \\n140. Senior citizens who do not have any income from business are proposed \\nto be exempted from the payment of advance tax. This will reduce their \\ncompliance burden. \\n141. In the case of corporates, I am not proposing any change in the tax rates. \\nHowever, I propose certain measures to allow corporates to access lower cost \\nfunds and to promote higher level of investments in several sectors. \\n142. In order to provide low cost funds to some stressed infrastructure sectors, \\nthe rate of withholding tax on interest payments on external commercial \\nborrowings is proposed to be reduced from 20 per cent to 5 per cent for three \\nyears. These sectors are: \\n\\x95 power; \\n\\x95 airlines; \\n\\x95 roads and bridges; \\n\\x95 ports and shipyards; \\n\\x95 affordable housing; \\n\\x95 fertilizer; and \\n\\x95 dams \\n143. The restriction on Venture Capital Funds to invest only in nine specified \\nsectors is proposed to be removed. It is further proposed to remove the cascading \\neffect of Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) in a multi-tier corporate structure. I \\nalso propose to continue to allow repatriation of dividends from foreign \\nsubsidiaries of Indian companies to India at a lower tax rate of 15 per cent as \\nagainst the tax rate of 30 per cent for one more year i.e. upto March 31, 2013. \\n144. Investment linked deduction of capital expenditure incurred in the \\nfollowing businesses is proposed to be provided at the enhanced rate of 150 per \\ncent, as against the current rate of 100 per cent. \\n\\x95 Cold chain facility \\n\\x95 Warehouses for storage of food grains \\n\\x95 Hospitals \\n\\x95 Fertilisers \\n\\x95 Affordable housing \\n145. The following new sectors are proposed to be added for the purposes of \\ninvestment linked deduction: \\n\\x95 bee keeping and production of honey and beeswax \\n\\x95 container freight station and inland container depots \\n\\x95 warehousing for storage of sugar \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n26 \\n\\n146. To promote investment in research and development, it is proposed to \\nextend the weighted deduction of 200 per cent for R&D expenditure in an \\nin-house facility beyond March 31, 2012 for a further period of five years. \\n147. I also propose to provide weighted deduction of 150 per cent on \\nexpenditure incurred for agri-extension services in order to facilitate growth in \\nthe agriculture sector. \\n148. For the power sector, besides access to low cost funds as outlined above, \\nI also propose extension of the sunset date by one year for power sector \\nundertakings so that they can be set up on or before March 31, 2013 for claiming \\n100 per cent deduction of profits for 10 years. Additional depreciation of 20 per \\ncent in the initial year is proposed to be extended to new assets acquired by \\npower generation companies. \\n149. For SMEs, the turnover limit for compulsory tax audit of accounts as \\nwell as for presumptive taxation is proposed to be raised from `60 lakh to \\n` 1 crore. \\n150. In order to augment funds for SMEs, I propose to exempt capital gains \\ntax on sale of a residential property, if the sale consideration is used for \\nsubscription in equity of a manufacturing SME company for purchase of new \\nplant and machinery. \\n151. Considering the shortage of skilled manpower in the manufacturing sector \\nand to generate employment, I propose to provide weighted deduction at the rate \\nof 150 per cent of expenditure incurred on skill development in manufacturing \\nsector in accordance with specified guidelines. \\n152. In order to reduce transaction costs in the capital markets, I propose \\nreduction in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) by 20 per cent (from 0.125 per \\ncent to 0.1 per cent) on cash delivery transactions. \\n153. In order to moderate the outgo on profit linked deductions, I propose to \\nextend the levy of Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) on all persons other than \\ncompanies, claiming profit linked deductions. \\n154. I propose to introduce a General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR) in order \\nto counter aggressive tax avoidance schemes, while ensuring that it is used only \\nin appropriate cases, by enabling a review by a GAAR panel. \\n155. I propose a series of measures to deter the generation and use of \\nunaccounted money. To this end, I propose \\n\\x95 Introduction of compulsory reporting requirement in case of assets \\nheld abroad. \\n\\x95 Allowing for reopening of assessment upto 16 years in relation to \\nassets held abroad. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n27 \\n\\n\\x95 Tax collection at source on purchase in cash of bullion or jewellery \\nin excess of ` 2 lakh. \\n\\x95 Tax deduction at source on transfer of immovable property (other \\nthan agricultural land) above a specified threshold. \\n\\x95 Tax collection at source on trading in coal, lignite and iron ore. \\n\\x95 Increasing the onus of proof on closely held companies for funds \\nreceived from shareholders as well as taxing share premium in \\nexcess of fair market value. \\n\\x95 Taxation of unexplained money, credits, investments, expenditures \\netc., at the highest rate of 30 per cent irrespective of the slab of \\nincome. \\n156. My proposals on Direct Taxes are estimated to result in a net revenue \\nloss of ` 4500 crore for the year. \\nIndirect Taxes \\n\\n157. I shall now turn to indirect taxes. In a slight departure from the previous \\nyears, I shall begin with Service Tax. \\nService Tax \\n\\n158. At the end of June this year, this tax will attain adulthood by completing \\n18 years. It is therefore time to shift gears and accelerate ahead. However, service \\ntax needs to confront two important challenges to sustain the journey. These are: \\n\\x95 The share of services in taxes remains far below its potential. \\nThere is a need to widen the tax base and strengthen its \\nenforcement; \\n\\x95 Service Tax law is complex and sometimes avoidably different \\nfrom Central Excise. We need to bring the two as close as possible \\nin the light of our eventual goal of transition to GST. \\nI have attempted to address both these issues this year. \\n\\n159. Last year, I had initiated a public debate on the desirability of moving \\ntowards taxation of services based on a negative list. In the debate that continued \\nfor the better part of the year, we received overwhelming support for this new \\nconcept. It has been perceived both as sound economics and prudent fiscal \\nmanagement. \\n160. Thus, I propose to tax all services except those in the negative list. The \\nlist comprises 17 heads and has been carefully drawn up, keeping in view the \\nfederal nature of our polity, the best international practices and our socio-economic \\nrequirements. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n28 \\n\\n161. The important inclusions in the negative list comprise all services provided \\nby the government or local authorities, except a few specified services where they \\ncompete with private sector. The list also includes pre-school and school education, \\nrecognised education at higher levels and approved vocational education, renting \\nof residential dwellings, entertainment and amusement services and a large part of \\npublic transportation including inland waterways, urban railways and metered cabs. \\n162. Agriculture and animal husbandry enjoy a very important place in our \\nlives. Practically all services required for cultivation, breeding, production, \\nprocessing or marketing up to the stage the produce is sold in the primary markets \\nare covered by the list. \\n163. In addition to the negative list, there is a list of exemptions which include \\nhealth care, services provided by charities, religious persons, sportspersons, \\nperforming artists in folk and classical arts, individual advocates providing \\nservices to non-business entities, independent journalists, and services by way \\nof animal care or car parking. \\n164. To take financial services to the door steps in rural areas, I have also \\nexempted the services of business facilitators and correspondents to banks and \\ninsurance companies. \\n165. Construction services relating to specified infrastructure, canals, irrigation \\nworks, post-harvest infrastructure, residential dwelling, and low-cost mass \\nhousing up to an area of 60 sq. mtr. under the Scheme of Affordable Housing in \\nPartnership are also included in the exemptions. To make the life of those who \\nalready own an apartment a little easier, I propose to raise the exemption for the \\nmonthly charges payable by a member to a housing society from ` 3,000 to \\n`5,000. \\n166. The Year 2012 marks the beginning of the centenary year of Indian cinema. \\nDespite the change in titles from Dada Saheb Phalke\\x92s \\x93Raja Harishchandra\\x94 to \\n\\x93Ra. One\\x94 in recent times, the industry has played a pivotal role in unifying our \\ncountry in the wake of her considerable diversity. To add to their spirit of \\ncelebration, I propose to exempt the industry from service tax on copyrights \\nrelating to recording of cinematographic films. \\n167. Movement towards the negative list will result in reducing nearly 290 \\ndefinitions and descriptions in the Act to 54, and the exemptions from the existing \\n88 to 10, of course merging some of the existing exemptions into a revised \\nnotification. In terms of number of pages, the law will be shorter by nearly 40 \\nper cent. \\n168. As a measure of harmonisation between Central Excise and Service Tax, \\na number of alignments have been made. These include a common simplified \\nregistration form and a common return for Central Excise and Service Tax, to be \\nnamed EST-1. This common return will comprise only one page, which will be \\na significant reduction from the 15 pages of the two returns at present. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n29 \\n\\n169. Revision Application Authority and Settlement Commission are being \\nintroduced in Service Tax to help resolve disputes with far greater ease. \\n170. Cascading of taxes has been significantly reduced by permitting utilisation \\nof input tax credits in a number of services such as catering, restaurants, hotel \\naccommodation, pandal and shamiana and transport sectors. \\n171. Place of Supply Rules, that will determine the location where a service \\nshall be deemed to be provided, are being placed in public domain for \\nstakeholders\\x92 comments and shall be notified when the negative list is put into \\neffect. These rules will also provide a possible backdrop to initiate an informed \\ndebate to assess all the issues that may arise in the taxation of inter-state services \\nfor the eventual launch of GST. \\n172. I propose to set up a Study Team to examine the possibility of a common \\ntax code for service tax and central excise which could be adopted to harmonise \\nthe two legislations as much as possible at the right time. \\n173. While the problems faced by exporters of goods with respect to taxes on \\ninput services was addressed earlier this year, disbursement of taxes that go into \\nthe export of services has been an irritant for long. I now announce a new scheme \\nthat will simplify refunds without resorting to voluminous documentation or \\nverification. As an added incentive, such refunds will also be admissible for \\ntaxes on taxable services that have been exempted. \\n174. Rules pertaining to the Point of Taxation are also being rationalised, \\nproviding greater clarity and removing the irritants. Cenvat credits in a number \\nof areas are being restored. There are a number of other proposals both for the \\nfacilitation of business and to check malpractices. I do not wish to take the valuable \\ntime of this House for discussing all these proposals. \\n175. You will notice that most of these measures are guided by the need to \\nmove towards a system that is simple, equitable and progressive but are unlikely \\nto make the exchequer richer in any significant way. Looking at our vast \\ncommitments and to maintain a healthy fiscal situation, I propose to raise the \\nservice tax rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, with consequential changes in \\nrates for services that have individual tax rates. \\n176. My proposals from service tax are expected to yield an additional revenue \\nof ` 18,660 crore. Keeping in mind that the share of services in GDP is 59 per \\ncent, you would agree that the proposed increase is not too harsh. \\nI shall now deal with proposals relating to the other indirect taxes. \\n\\n177. In the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008-09, the standard rate of \\nexcise duty for non-petroleum goods was reduced from 14 per cent to 8 per cent \\nin a phased manner. This rate was raised from 8 per cent to 10 per cent in Budget \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n30 \\n\\n2010-11. Given the imperative for fiscal correction, I propose to now raise the \\nstandard rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, the merit rate from 5 per cent to 6 \\nper cent, and the lower merit rate from 1 per cent to 2 per cent. However, the \\nlower merit rate for coal, fertilisers, mobile phones and precious metal jewellery \\nis being retained at 1 per cent. \\n\\n178. Large cars currently attract excise duty depending on their engine capacity \\nand length. In keeping with the increase proposed in the standard rate, I propose \\nto enhance the duty from 22 per cent to 24 per cent. In the case of cars that attract \\na mixed rate of duty of 22 per cent + `15000 per vehicle, I propose to increase \\nthe duty and switch over to an ad valorem rate of 27 per cent. \\n179. No change is proposed in the peak rate of customs duty of 10 per cent on \\nnon-agricultural goods. Barring a few individual items, the rates below the peak \\nare also being retained. \\n180. I shall now take up relief proposals for specific sectors \\x96 especially those \\nunder stress. These have been formulated to stimulate investment and \\nmanufacturing growth. \\nAgriculture & Related Sectors \\n\\n181. Carrying forward the initiatives taken for agriculture and agro-processing \\nin the previous Budgets, I propose: \\n\\x95 to reduce basic customs duty from 7.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent on: \\n. \\nsugarcane planter, root or tuber crop harvesting machine and \\nrotary tiller and weeder; \\n. \\nparts for the manufacture of these; \\n\\x95 to reduce basic customs duty from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent on \\nspecified coffee plantation and processing machinery; \\n\\x95 to extend project import benefit to green house and protected \\ncultivation for horticulture and floriculture at concessional basic \\ncustoms duty of 5 per cent; \\n\\x95 to reduce basic customs duty on some water soluble fertilisers and \\nliquid fertilisers, other than urea, from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent \\nand from 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent; \\n\\x95 to extend concessional import duty available for installation of \\nMechanised Handling Systems and Pallet Racking Systems in \\nmandis or warehouses for horticultural produce. \\n182. Imports of equipment for initial setting up or substantial expansion of \\nfertiliser projects are being fully exempted from basic customs duty of 5 per cent \\nfor a period of three years up to March 31, 2015. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n31 \\n\\nInfrastructure \\n\\n183. In the realm of infrastructure my proposals address some weaknesses in \\nthe troika of power, coal and railways. \\n184. Domestic producers of thermal power have been under stress because of \\nhigh prices of coal. I propose to ease the situation by providing full exemption \\nfrom basic customs duty and a concessional CVD of 1 per cent to Steam coal for \\na period of two years till March 31, 2014. Full exemption from basic duty is also \\nbeing provided to the following fuels for power generation: \\n\\x95 Natural Gas and Liquified Natural Gas; and \\n\\x95 Uranium concentrate, Sintered Uranium Dioxide in natural and \\npellet form. \\nMining \\n\\n185. Better surveying and prospecting for minerals are essential for improving \\nthe productivity and efficiency of our mining sector. I propose to reduce basic \\ncustoms duty on machinery and instruments for surveying and prospecting from \\n10 per cent or 7.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. In addition, full exemption from basic \\ncustoms duty is being provided to coal mining projects. \\nRailways \\n\\n186. Over the next five years, Indian Railways are undertaking two major \\nprojects for passenger safety and better service delivery. These are - the installation \\nof Train Protection and Warning System and upgradation of track structure for \\nhigh speed trains. I propose to reduce basic customs duty on equipment required \\nfor their implementation from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent. \\nRoads \\n\\n187. Full exemption from import duty on specified equipment imported for \\nroad construction by contractors of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, \\nNHAI and State Governments is being extended to contracts awarded by \\nMetropolitan Development Authorities. \\n188. Tunnel boring machines and parts for their assembly are covered by \\nthis exemption. I propose to allow their import free of duty without end-use \\ncondition. \\nCivil Aviation \\n\\n189. India has potential for establishing itself as a hub for third-party \\nMaintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) of civilian aircraft. To actualize this \\npotential, I propose to fully exempt from basic customs duty parts of aircraft and \\ntesting equipment imported for this purpose. As a measure of support to the \\nairline industry, it is also proposed to fully exempt both new and retreaded aircraft \\ntyres from basic customs duty and excise duty. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n32 \\n\\nManufacturing \\n\\n190. My proposals for the manufacturing sector that needs support at this \\njuncture, seek to provide relief through cost reduction of raw materials, inputs, \\ncomponents and capital goods. \\n191. To encourage enrichment of low-grade iron ore, of which we have huge \\nreserves, I propose to reduce basic customs duty on plant and machinery imported \\nfor setting up or substantial expansion of iron ore pellet plants or iron ore \\nbeneficiation plants from 7.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. My other proposals relating \\nto the steel sector are as under: \\n\\x95 to reduce basic customs duty on: \\n. \\ncoating material for manufacture of electrical steel from 7.5 \\nper cent to 5 per cent \\n. \\nnickel ore and concentrate and nickel oxide/ hydroxide from \\n2.5 per cent or 7.5 per cent to Nil \\n\\x95 to enhance export duty on chromium ore from `3000 per tonne to \\n30 per cent ad valorem \\n\\x95 to enhance basic customs duty on non-alloy, flat-rolled steel from \\n5 per cent to 7.5 per cent. \\n192. Our textile industry, especially the weaving sector, urgently needs to \\nmodernise. I propose to fully exempt automatic shuttle-less looms from basic \\ncustoms duty of 5 per cent. Similarly, full exemption from basic duty is being \\naccorded to automatic silk reeling and processing machinery as well as its parts. \\nIt is also proposed to restrict these exemptions and the existing concessional rate \\nof basic customs duty of 5 per cent only to new textile machinery. Second-hand \\nmachinery would now attract basic duty of 7.5 per cent. Other proposals on \\ntextiles are: \\n\\x95 to reduce basic customs duty on wool waste and wool tops from \\n15 per cent to 5 per cent \\n\\x95 to reduce basic customs duty on Titanium dioxide from 10 per \\ncent to 7.5 per cent \\n\\x95 to extend full exemption from basic customs duty to aramid yarn \\nand fabric used for the manufacture of bullet proof helmets \\n193. Excise duty of 10 per cent is applicable to branded ready-made garments \\nwith abatement of 55 per cent from the Retail Sale Price. Along with increase in \\nduty to 12 per cent, I propose to enhance the abatement to 70 per cent. As a \\nresult, the incidence of duty as a percentage of the Retail Sale Price would come \\ndown from 4.5 per cent to 3.6 per cent. \\n194. Our MSME sector is fertile ground for the production of low-cost medical \\ndevices. In order to provide impetus to this sector, I propose to reduce basic \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n33 \\n\\ncustoms duty to 2.5 per cent with concessional CVD of 6 per cent on specified \\nparts, components and raw materials for the manufacture of some disposables \\nand instruments. Full exemption from basic customs duty and CVD is also being \\nextended to specified raw materials for the manufacture of coronary stents and \\nheart valves. These concessions would be subject to actual user condition. \\n\\n195. My other proposals to support the manufacturing sector include: \\n\\x95 Full exemption from basic customs duty on \\n. \\nwaste paper, \\n. \\nLCD and LED TV panels, and parts of memory card for \\nmobile phones \\n\\x95 Reduction of basic customs duty on specified raw materials for the \\nmanufacture of adult diapers from 10 per cent or 7.5 per cent to 5 \\nper cent with CVD of 6 per cent and nil special CVD. \\n196. My attention has been drawn to the plight of a few sectors that are highly \\nlabour-intensive and produce items of mass consumption. As a measure of \\nsupport, I propose to enhance basic customs duty on bicycles from 10 per cent to \\n30 per cent and on bicycle parts from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. \\n197. Full exemption from excise duty is currently available to hand-made \\nmatches while others attract the standard rate. It is proposed to reduce excise \\nduty on matches manufactured by semi-mechanised units from 10 per cent to 6 \\nper cent. \\nHealth and Nutrition \\n\\n198. It is proposed to extend concessional basic customs duty of 5 per cent \\nwith full exemption from excise duty/CVD to six specified life-saving drugs/ \\nvaccines. These are used for the treatment or prevention of ailments such as \\nHIV-AIDS, renal cancer, etc. \\n199. Protein deficiency among women and children is one of the most common \\nsources of malnutrition in India. I propose to reduce basic customs duty on Soya \\nprotein concentrate and isolated soya protein from 30 per cent or 15 per cent \\nrespectively to 10 per cent. Simultaneously, excise duty on all processed soya \\nfood products is being reduced to the merit rate of 6 per cent. \\n200. Consumption of iodised salt prevents iodine deficiency and related \\ndiseases. I propose to provide a concessional basic customs duty of 2.5 per cent \\nalong with reduced excise duty of 6 per cent on iodine. \\n201. Probiotics are a cost-effective means of combating bacterial infections. \\nIt is proposed to reduce the basic customs duty on this item from 10 per cent to \\n5 per cent. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n34 \\n\\nEnvironment \\n\\n202. In order to fully realise our potential in the realm of solar energy, solar \\nthermal projects need encouragement. I propose to fully exempt plant and \\nequipment etc. for the initial setting up of such projects from special CVD. \\n203. Concessions have already been provided for encouraging the consumption \\nof energy-saving devices. I propose to fully exempt a coating chemical used for \\ncompact fluorescent lamps, from basic customs duty. Excise duty on LED lamps \\nis also being reduced to 6 per cent. \\n204. Specified parts required for the manufacture of hybrid vehicles enjoy \\nfull exemption from basic customs duty and special CVD with concessional \\nexcise duty/ CVD of 6 per cent. This concession is being extended to specified \\nadditional items and lithium ion batteries imported for the manufacture of battery \\npacks for supply to electric or hybrid vehicle manufacturers. \\n205. One of the primary drivers of the current account deficit has been the \\ngrowth of almost 50 per cent in imports of gold and other precious metals in the \\nfirst three quarters of this year. I have been advised to strengthen the steps \\nalready taken to check this trend for better results. I propose to increase basic \\ncustoms duty on standard gold bars; gold coins of purity exceeding 99.5 per cent \\nand platinum from 2 per cent to 4 per cent and on non-standard gold from 5 per \\ncent to 10 per cent. In sync with these, basic duty on gold ore, concentrate and \\ndore bars for refining is being enhanced from 1 per cent to 2 per cent. On the \\nexcise side, duty on refined gold is being increased in the same proportion from \\n1.5 per cent to 3 per cent. \\n206. In order to prevent round-tripping, it is proposed to impose basic customs \\nduty of 2 per cent on cut and polished, coloured gem stones at par with diamonds. \\nAdditional Resource Mobilisation \\n\\n207. I shall now take up my proposals on \\x93demerit\\x94 goods. I propose to \\nincrease basic excise duty on cigarettes of more than 65mm length by adding \\nan ad valorem component of 10 per cent to the existing specific rates. The ad \\nvalorem duty would be chargeable on 50 per cent of the Retail Sale Price \\ndeclared on the pack. \\n208. I also propose to carry out a nominal increase in basic excise duty on \\nhand-rolled bidis from `8 to `10 per thousand and on machine-rolled bidis from \\n`19 to `21 per thousand. The existing exemption available to hand-rolled bidis \\nfor clearances up to 20 lakh bidis per annum is being retained. \\n209. Pan masala, gutkha, chewing tobacco, unmanufactured tobacco and zarda \\nscented tobacco in pouches are leviable to excise duty under the compounded \\nlevy scheme. The rates of duty specified per packing machine for these items are \\nbeing stepped up taking into account improvements in the efficiency of machines \\nused by this industry. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n35 \\n\\n210. Crude petroleum oil produced in India attracts a cess of `2,500 per metric \\ntonne under the Oil Industries Development Act. This rate was last revised in \\nBudget 2006-07. As a measure of indexation, I propose to increase the rate of \\ncess to `4,500 per metric tonne. \\n211. Completely Built Units of large cars/ MUVs/ SUVs having engine \\ncapacity above a prescribed threshold and whose value exceeds US dollar 40,000 \\nper vehicle are permitted for import without type approval. Basic customs duty \\non such vehicles is being enhanced from 60 per cent to 75 per cent ad valorem. \\nRationalisation Measures \\n\\n212. Packaged cement, whether manufactured by mini-cement plants or others, \\nattracts differential excise duty depending on the Retail Sale Price per bag. It is \\nproposed to prescribe a unified rate of 12 per cent + `120 PMT for non-mini \\ncement plants and 6 per cent + `120 PMT for mini-cement plants. It is proposed \\nto charge this duty on the Retail Sale Price less abatement of 30 per cent. \\n213. The House would recall that I had re-introduced a levy of excise duty of \\n1 per cent on branded precious metal jewellery in the last Budget. As a measure \\nof rationalisation, I propose to include jewellery, not bearing a brand name, under \\nits ambit. However, to simplify its operation and minimise its impact on small \\nartisans and goldsmiths, I propose: \\n\\x95 to charge this duty on tariff value equal to 30 per cent of the \\ntransaction value; \\n\\x95 to extend small-scale exemption up to annual turnover not \\nexceeding `1.5 crore for units having a turnover below ` 4 crore in \\nthe previous year; \\n\\x95 to compute turnover on the basis of tariff value; and \\n\\x95 to place the onus of registration and payment on the person who \\ngets jewellery manufactured on job-work. \\n214. I propose to fully exempt branded silver jewellery from excise duty. \\n215. Building of commercial vehicle bodies is currently exempt from excise \\nduty. In lieu of this duty, a specific rate of `10,000 is being charged on chassis in \\naddition to the applicable ad valorem duty. This duty structure is regressive. It is \\nproposed to convert the specific component of duty to an ad valorem rate of 3 \\nper cent. \\n216. In the last Budget, excise duty exemption on ships and vessels including \\ndredgers was withdrawn. Accordingly, CVD of 5 per cent became leviable on \\ntheir imports. As the intention was not to levy this duty on the import of foreign-\\ngoing vessels, I propose to exempt such vessels from CVD retrospectively. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n36 \\n\\nHowever, to ensure that ships, vessels and dredgers manufactured in India do \\nnot face disability vis-à-vis foreign-going ships converting into coastal vessels, \\nnecessary safeguard is being provided. \\n\\nBaggage Allowance \\n\\n217. Baggage allowance for Indians travelling abroad was last revised in 2004. \\nI propose to increase the duty-free allowance for eligible passengers of Indian \\norigin from `25,000 to `35,000 and for children of up to 10 years from `12,000 \\nto `15,000. \\n218. My proposals relating to Customs and Central excise are estimated to \\nresult in a net revenue gain of ` 27,280 crore for a full year. \\n219. My proposals on Direct Taxes are estimated to result in a net revenue \\nloss of `4500 crore for the year. Proposals relating to Indirect Taxes are estimated \\nto result in a net revenue gain of `45,940 crore, leaving a net gain of `41,440 \\ncrore in the Budget. \\n220. For the Indian economy, this was a challenging year. A number of global \\nand domestic factors militated against the growth that had revived in the last two \\nyears. But India has thrived under challenges and India will do so now. In the \\nmiddle of every crisis, there is also an opportunity. It is an opportunity to rethink, \\nre-assess and make way for new ideas and policies. It is in this spirit that \\nI approached the Budget of this year. The aim is to create an enabling atmosphere \\nfor corporates, farmers, entrepreneurs and workers to take initiatives for robust \\ngrowth. The aim is also to ensure that the benefits of growth reach all sections of \\npopulation. India stands on the brink of a major resurgence. Whether or not \\ntoday\\x92s announcements make tomorrow morning\\x92s headlines matters little, as \\nlong as they help in shaping the headlines that describe India a decade from now. \\nMadam Speaker, with these words, I commend the Budget to the House. \\n\\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in'"

              "'Interim Budget 2014-2015 \\n\\nSpeech of \\n\\nP. Chidambaram \\n\\nMinister of Finance \\n\\nFebruary 17, 2014 \\n\\nMadam Speaker, \\nINTRODUCTION \\nI rise to present the Interim Budget for 2014-15. \\n\\nThe Current Economic Situation \\n\\n2. As I prepared to write this speech, I found that whether it is a regular Budget for the \\nfull year or an interim Budget, some things remain the same. For example, our goals are the \\nsame and the global context is the same. As I said last year, we are not unaffected by what \\nhappens in the rest of the world. Since September 2008, the state of the world economy has \\nbeen the most decisive factor impacting the fortunes of every developing country. Hence, it is \\npertinent to say a few words on the global economy as well as on the global risks. \\n3. World economic growth was 3.9 percent in 2011, 3.1 percent in 2012 and 3.0 percent \\nin 2013. Those numbers tell the story. Among India\\x92s major trading partners, who are also \\nthe major sources of our foreign capital inflows, the United States has just recovered from a \\nlong recession; Japan\\x92s economy is responding to the stimulus; the Eurozone, as a whole, is \\nreporting a growth of 0.2 percent; and China\\x92s growth has slowed from 9.3 percent in 2011 to \\n7.7 percent in 2013. \\n4. The Global Risks 2014 report has mapped 31 global risks. Of highest concern are ten \\nrisks that include fiscal crisis, structurally high unemployment or underemployment, income \\ndisparity, governance failure, food crisis, and political and social instability. The challenges \\nthat we face are common to all emerging economies. 2012 and 2013 were years of \\nturbulence. Only a handful of countries were able to keep their head above the water, and \\namong them was India. I shall presently give you an account of how we navigated the Indian \\neconomy through this turbulent period. \\nChallenges and Goals \\n\\n5. Within days of my return to the Ministry of Finance, I had declared that our objectives \\nwere fiscal consolidation, price stability, self-sufficiency in food, reviving the growth cycle, \\nenhancing investments, promoting manufacturing, encouraging exports, quickening the pace \\n\\x0c\\nof implementation of projects, and finding practical solutions to certain stressed sectors such \\nas petroleum, power, coal, highways and textiles. \\n\\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY \\nThe Twin Deficits and Inflation \\n\\n6. Let me begin with the good news. The fiscal deficit for 2013-14 will be contained at \\n4.6 percent of GDP, well below the red line that I had drawn last year. More importantly, \\nthe Current Account Deficit, that threatened to exceed last year\\x92s CAD of USD 88 billion, \\nwill be contained at USD 45 billion, and I am happy to inform the House that we expect to \\nadd about USD 15 billion to the foreign exchange reserves by the end of the financial year. \\nAnalysts and rating agencies had acknowledged our efforts some months ago and no longer \\nspeak about a downgrade. I hope that domestic experts will now agree that the UPA \\nGovernment meant what it said when it put fiscal stability at the top of the agenda. Going \\nforward, I appeal to all political parties to join me in the pledge that we shall not \\x96 we shall \\nnever \\x96 do anything that will affect the stability of the foundations of India\\x92s economy. \\n7. Last year, when I read the Budget speech, WPI headline inflation stood at 7.3 percent \\nand core inflation at 4.2 percent. Through the year, inflation saw its ups and downs. At the \\nend of January 2014, WPI inflation was 5.05 percent and core inflation 3.0 percent. Both the \\nGovernment and the RBI have acted in tandem. While our efforts have not been in vain, \\nthere is still some distance to go. Food inflation is still the main worry, although it has \\ndeclined sharply from a high of 13.6 percent to 6.2 percent. \\nAgriculture \\n\\n8. We are proud of the stellar performance of the agriculture sector. Foodgrain \\nproduction in 2012-13 was 255.36 million tonnes and the estimate for the current year is 263 \\nmillion tonnes. Estimates of production of sugarcane, cotton, pulses, oilseeds and quality \\nseeds point to new records. Agriculture exports in 2012-13 stood at USD 41 billion versus \\nimports of USD 20 billion. In 2013-14, agriculture exports are likely to cross USD 45 \\nbillion. Agricultural credit is likely to touch `735,000 crore, exceeding the target of `700,000 \\ncrore. Agricultural GDP growth increased to 3.1 percent in the five year period of \\nUPA-I and further to 4.0 percent in the first four years of UPA-II. In the current year, \\nagricultural GDP growth is estimated at 4.6 percent. \\nInvestment \\n\\n9. Even after the slowdown, the savings rate was 31.3 percent in 2011-12 and 30.1 \\npercent in 2012-13. The corresponding investment rate was 35.5 percent and 34.8 percent, \\nrespectively, indicating there was no steep decline in investment, except in mining and \\nmanufacturing. If the incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) had remained more or less the \\nsame, the outcome should have been a growth rate higher than the 6.7 percent and the 4.5 \\npercent reported so far by the CSO for the two years, but that did not happen. It was obvious \\nthat projects were not achieving commercial operation date (COD) and there were too many \\nobstacles on the path of implementation. At a time when it appeared that a number of \\nprojects would fail because of the logjam, Government took the bold step to set up the \\nCabinet Committee on Investment and the Project Monitoring Group. Thanks to the swift \\ndecisions taken by them, by the end of January, 2014, the way was cleared for completing \\n296 projects with an estimated project cost of `660,000 crore. \\n\\x0c\\nForeign Trade \\n\\n10. Exports have recovered sharply, and the recovery must be seen in the context of \\ngrowth of global trade declining from 6.1 percent in 2011 to 2.7 percent in 2013. India\\x92s \\nmerchandise exports reached a level of USD 300.4 billion in 2012-13 registering a negative \\ngrowth of 1.8 percent over the previous year. Though 2013-14 began on a pessimistic note, I \\nam happy to inform the House that the year will end with estimated merchandise exports of \\nUSD 326 billion, indicating a growth rate of 6.3 percent. However, imports are down, and \\nthis does not augur well for either manufacturing or domestic trade. Our aim must be robust \\ngrowth in both exports and imports, with trade in balance over a period of time. \\nManufacturing \\n\\n11. Manufacturing is the Achilles\\x92 heel of the Indian economy. The deceleration in \\ninvestment in manufacturing is particularly worrying. Consequently, there is no uptick yet in \\nmanufacturing. The National Manufacturing Policy has set the goal of increasing the share of \\nmanufacturing in GDP to 25 percent and to create 100 million jobs over a decade. Eight \\nNational Investment and Manufacturing Zones (NIMZ) have been announced along the \\nDelhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor and nine projects have been approved by the DMIC Trust. \\nFive NIMZs outside DMIC have also been given in-principle approval. Three more corridors \\nconnecting Chennai and Bengaluru, Bengaluru and Mumbai, and Amritsar and Kolkata are \\nunder different stages of preparatory work. Additional capacities are being installed in major \\nmanufacturing industries such as steel, cement, refinery, power and electronics. Several \\nmeasures have been taken to promote micro, small and medium enterprises including \\nnotifying a public procurement policy, establishing technology centres and common facility \\ncentres, and launching the Khadi mark. \\nInfrastructure \\n\\n12. We have given a big push to infrastructure and capacity addition in infrastructure \\nindustries. In 2012-13 and in the nine months of the current financial year, we have added \\n29,350 megawatts of power capacity, 3,928 kilometres of national highways, 39,144 \\nkilometres of rural roads under PMGSY, 3,343 kilometres of new railway track, and 217.5 \\nmillion tonnes of capacity per annum in our ports. Besides, 19 oil and gas blocks were given \\nout for exploration and 7 new airports are under construction. We have also facilitated \\nInfrastructure Debt Funds to provide take-out finance for infrastructure projects and ease the \\npressure on the banking system. \\nExchange Rate \\n\\n13. Risks to capital flows were accentuated due to volatile global conditions and the \\nindication, in May 2013, of a reduction in asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve. The \\nrupee came under pressure. Government, RBI and SEBI undertook a number of measures to \\nfacilitate capital inflows and stabilise the foreign exchange market. Among emerging \\neconomy currencies, the rupee was affected least when the actual reduction took place in \\nDecember 2013 and January 2014. \\nGDP Growth \\x96 Decline and Rise \\n\\n14. Hon\\x92ble Members will recall that the slowdown began in 2011-12. In nine quarters, \\nthe GDP growth rate declined from 7.5 percent in Q1 of 2011-12 to 4.4 percent in Q1 of \\n\\x0c\\n2013-14. Thanks to the numerous measures that I have narrated, I was confident that the \\ndecline will be arrested and the growth cycle will turn in the second quarter. I believe I have \\nbeen vindicated. Growth in Q2 of 2013-14 has been placed at 4.8 percent and growth for the \\nwhole year has been estimated at 4.9 percent. This means that growth in Q3 and Q4 of 201314 \\nwill be at least 5.2 percent. \\n\\n15. I can confidently assert that the economy is more stable today than what it was two \\nyears ago. The fiscal deficit is declining, the current account deficit has been contained, \\ninflation has moderated, the quarterly growth rate is on the rise, the exchange rate is stable, \\nexports have increased, and hundreds of projects have been unblocked. \\n16. Madam Speaker, all this is the result of hard work. I may add, among other mentors, \\nmy mother and Harvard taught me the value of hard work. \\nUPA\\x92s Record of Growth \\n\\n17. Over the last ten years, the UPA Governments have gently nudged India and Indians \\ninto accepting that growth is an imperative; that it must be made more inclusive and \\nconverted into development; and that the growth model, in order to be sustainable, must \\naddress other concerns such as environment, inter-generational equity, indebtedness, \\nownership and control of resources, financing etc. \\n18. The UPA Governments\\x92 record on growth is unparalleled. \\n19. Ten years ago, we produced 213 million tonnes of food grains; today, we produce 263 \\nmillion tonnes of food grains. Ten years ago, the installed power capacity was 112,700 MW; \\ntoday, it is 234,600 MW. Ten years ago, coal production was 361 million tonnes per year; \\ntoday, we produce 554 million tonnes per year. Ten years ago, there were 51,511 km of rural \\nroads under PMGSY; today, we have 389,578 km. Ten years ago, the Central Government\\x92s \\nexpenditure on education was `10,145 crore; this year, we allocated `79,451 crore. Ten \\nyears ago, the Central Government spent `7,248 crore on health; this year, it will spend \\n`36,322 crore. I could multiply the examples, but what I have given will suffice. \\n20. Madam Speaker, I reject the argument of policy paralysis. Just as there are business \\ncycles, there is a cycle around the trend growth rate of an economy. Over a period of 33 \\nyears, the trend growth rate in India has been 6.2 percent. Average annual GDP growth \\nduring the period 1999-2004 was 5.9 percent, that is below the trend rate. In the next five \\nyear period 2004-2009, it was 8.4 percent and, in the period 2009-2014, going by the CSO\\x92s \\nestimate, it will be 6.6 percent. UPA-I and UPA-II have delivered above the trend growth \\nrate. \\n21. Let history be the judge of the last ten years. \\nREPORT CARD OF 2013-14 \\n22. I owe a duty to my colleagues to report on some of the major achievements in the \\ncurrent financial year that concerns the economy of the country and the welfare of the people. \\nWe are not simply looking back, we are actually looking forward, and therefore I shall also \\nreport on the initiatives that are being taken by my colleagues. \\nPath-breaking Decisions \\n\\n23. Government took several notable decisions including some that were described as \\ncourageous and long overdue. Sugar was fully decontrolled. A gradual correction of diesel \\n\\x0c\\nprices was started. Railway fares were rationalised for the first time in a decade. \\nApplications were invited for issue of new bank licences. DISCOMS, mostly sick, are being \\nrestructured with generous Central assistance. \\n\\nHistoric Legislations \\n\\n24. 12.8 lakh land titles covering 18.80 lakh hectare were distributed under the Scheduled \\nTribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act. \\n25. The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, \\nRehabilitation and Resettlement Act was notified on 1.1.2014, finally putting to rest an \\noppressive colonial law of 1894. \\n26. The National Food Security Act was passed assuring foodgrain to 67 percent of the \\npopulation. \\n27. The new Companies Act replaced a law of 1956 vintage. \\n28. The PFRDA Act was passed placing the New Pension System on a statutory basis and \\nestablishing a statutory regulator. \\nEconomic Initiatives \\n\\n29. Centrally Sponsored Schemes were restructured into 66 programmes for greater \\nsynergy. Funds under these programmes will be released as Central assistance to State plans, \\nthus giving States greater authority and responsibility. As a result, Central assistance to plans \\nof States and Union Territories will rise substantially from `136,254 crore in BE 2013-14 to \\n`338,562 crore in 2014-15. \\n30. Public sector enterprises will achieve a new record in capital expenditure of `257,641 \\ncrore in 2013-14. \\n31. About 50,000 MW of thermal and hydel power capacity is under construction after \\nreceiving all clearances and approvals. 78,000 MW of power capacity has been assured coal \\nsupply. \\n32. The FDI policy was liberalized to attract larger investments in telecommunication, \\npharmaceuticals, civil aviation, power trading exchanges and multi-brand retail. \\n33. Approval was granted to establish two semi-conductor wafer fab units that will be the \\nbedrock of the electronics hardware industry. \\n34. The IT modernisation project of the Department of Posts, with an outlay of `4,909 \\ncrore, will be operational by 2015 in all 155,000 locations. \\n35. The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant Unit I achieved criticality and is generating \\n180 million units of power. The 500 MW prototype fast breeder reactor at Kalpakkam is \\nnearing completion. Seven nuclear power reactors are under construction with the aim of \\nachieving an installed capacity of 10,080 MW by the end of the Twelfth Plan. \\n\\x0c\\n36. After exceeding the target and achieving 1,684 MW of grid connected solar power, \\nthe National Solar Mission entered the second phase on 1.4.2013. It is proposed to take up \\nfour ultra mega solar power projects each with a capacity of over 500 MW in 2014-15. \\n37. Ministry of MSME will create the \\x91India Inclusive Innovation Fund\\x92 to promote \\ngrassroot innovations with social returns to support enterprises in the MSME sector. \\npropose to make an initial contribution of `100 crore to the corpus of the Fund. \\nSocial Sector Initiatives \\n\\n38. In order to promote entrepreneurship among the scheduled castes and to provide \\nconcessional finance to them, IFCI will set up a Venture Capital Fund for Scheduled Castes. \\nI propose to provide an initial capital of `200 crore, which can be supplemented every year. \\n39. The restructured ICDS has been implemented in 400 districts and will be rolled out in \\nthe remaining districts from 1.4.2014. \\n40. Government has approved the National Agro-Forestry Policy 2014 which has multiple \\nobjectives including employment, productivity, conservation and adaptation. \\n41. A mechanism for marketing minor forest produce has been introduced, and the \\nBudget has allocated `444.59 crore to continue the scheme in 2014-15. \\n42. A new plan scheme with an allocation of `100 crore has been approved to promote \\ncommunity radio stations. \\n43. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has delivered new technologies to the people: \\nthe JE vaccine, a diagnostic test for Thalassaemia, and a Magnivisualizer for detection of \\ncervical cancer. \\nAdditional Central Assistance to some States \\n\\n44. The North Eastern States, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand deserve special \\nattention. In addition to funds allocated in the current year, I propose to release a sum of \\n`1,200 crore as Additional Central Assistance to these States before the end of the year. \\nSpace \\n\\n45. India joined a handful of countries when it launched the Mars Orbiter Mission. We \\nnow have the capability in launch vehicle technology, cryogenics, and navigation, \\nmeteorological and communication satellites, and are largely self-reliant. Several flight tests, \\nnavigational satellites and space missions are planned for 2014-15. \\nRedeeming Our Promises \\n\\n46. Last year, I had made three promises and I had asked Hon\\x92ble Members to keep \\nbefore them the faces of the girl child, the young student, and the poor. To ensure the dignity \\nand safety of women, I promised the Nirbhaya Fund and put `1000 crore into the Fund. So \\nfar, we have approved two proposals that will receive support from the Fund. In order to \\nmake it clear that the Fund will be a permanent fund, I intend to declare the grant of `1000 \\ncrore as non-lapsable. And in order to support more proposals, I propose to contribute to the \\nFund another sum of `1000 crore next year. \\n47. Secondly, I had promised an ambitious programme to skill millions of young men and \\nwomen and had tasked the National Skill Development Corporation to implement the \\nprogramme. The National Skill Certification and Monetary Reward Scheme was launched in \\n\\x0c\\nAugust 2013 and has been widely hailed as a success. At last count, 24 Sector Skill Councils, \\n442 Training Partners and 17 Assessment Agencies had joined the programme. 204 job roles \\nhave been finalised. 168,043 youth had enrolled and 77,710 have completed their training. \\nHon\\x92ble Members will recall that I had set apart `1,000 crore for the scheme. The whole of \\nthat amount will be transferred to the NSD Trust and I propose to transfer another sum of \\n`1,000 crore next year to enable the Trust to scale up the programme of NSDC rapidly. \\nmay add that NSDC actually complements the initiatives of several ministries which steer \\nskill development programmes such as UDAAN in Jammu and Kashmir. \\n\\n48. Thirdly, I had promised that the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme would be rolled out \\nthroughout the country. The scheme is barely a year old. Money is being transferred to \\nbeneficiaries under 27 identified schemes, including the National Social Assistance \\nProgramme (NSAP). A total of 54,20,114 transactions have been put through until 31.1.2014 \\nand `628 crore has been transferred. Another sum of `3,370 crore has been transferred to 2.1 \\ncrore LPG beneficiaries. The latter scheme has been put on hold for the time being pending \\nresolution of some difficulties that have been pointed out. However, let me reiterate that the \\nGovernment remains fully committed to Aadhaar under which 57 crore unique numbers have \\nbeen issued so far and to opening bank accounts for all Aadhaar holders in order to promote \\nfinancial inclusion. Who needs Aadhaar? It is those who are at the bottom of the pyramid, \\nthe poor, the migrant workers, the homeless, and the oppressed who need Aadhaar, and we \\nwill ensure that they get Aadhaar. I have no doubt that in course of time even critics of \\nAadhaar will realise that Aadhaar is a tool of empowerment. \\nOVERVIEW OF THE INTERIM BUDGET \\nPlan and Non-Plan Expenditure \\n\\n49. I shall now give an overview of the interim Budget. In some years, we over-provide \\nin the Budget. In those years savings are inevitable. Besides, if there is lower-than-expectedgrowth \\nthere will be lower-than-estimated-revenues as well. 2013-14 has been one such year. \\nI am afraid, we will not be able to spend the budgeted plan expenditure, but non-plan \\nexpenditure will exceed the budget by a small amount. \\n50. In order to sustain the pace of plan expenditure, I have decided to keep plan \\nexpenditure in 2014-15 at the same level at which it was budgeted in 2013-14. I have \\nprovided `555,322 crore for plan expenditure. I am glad to inform the House that all the \\nministries/departments that run key flagship programmes of the UPA Government have been \\nprovided adequate funds. In all the following cases, I have provided in 2014-15 an amount \\nequal to or higher than in the BE of 2013-14 and irrespective of the revised estimates for the \\nyear: \\nMinistry of Minority Affairs .. ` \\n3,711 crore \\nMinistry of Tribal Affairs .. ` \\n4,379 crore \\nMinistry of Housing & Poverty Alleviation .. ` \\n6,000 crore \\nMinistry of Social Justice & Empowerment .. ` \\n6,730 crore \\nMinistry of Panchayati Raj .. ` \\n7,000 crore \\nMinistry of Drinking Water & Sanitation .. ` \\n15,260 crore \\nMinistry of Women & Child Development .. ` \\n21,000 crore \\nMinistry of Health & Family Welfare .. ` \\n33,725 crore \\n\\n\\x0c\\nMinistry of Human Resource Development .. ` \\n67,398 crore \\nMinistry of Rural Development .. ` \\n82,202 crore \\n\\nRailways \\n\\n51. My colleague, the Minister of Railways, presented the Railway Budget a few days \\nago. Budgetary support to Railways has been increased from `26,000 crore in BE 2013-14 to \\n`29,000 crore in 2014-15. Railways need to mobilise huge resources through market \\nborrowing and private public partnership (PPP) schemes. It is proposed to identify new \\ninstruments and new mechanisms to raise funds for railway projects. \\nSC Sub-Plan and Tribal Sub-Plan, \\nGender Budget and Child Budget \\n\\n52. Hon\\x92ble Members will be happy to know that I propose to allocate `48,638 crore to \\nthe scheduled caste sub-plan and `30,726 crore to the tribal sub-plan. They will also be \\nhappy to find that the gender budget has `97,533 crore and the child budget has `81,024 \\ncrore. \\n53. I am confident that there will be no cause for complaint. If there are any \\nshortcomings, they can be addressed when the regular budget is presented. There is enough \\nflexibility in the expenditure budget to make necessary changes in the allocations within the \\noverall resource envelope. \\n54. Non-plan expenditure in 2014-15 is estimated at `12,07,892 crore. Of this, the \\nexpenditure on subsidies for food, fertilizer and fuel will be `246,397 crore. This is slightly \\nmore than the revised estimate of `245,452 crore in 2013-14. For fuel subsidy, I have \\nprovided `65,000 crore. We have, this year, absorbed the rollover of `45,000 crore from the \\nfourth quarter of 2012-13 and we will rollover only `35,000 crore from the fourth quarter of \\nthis year into the next year. `115,000 crore has been allocated for food subsidy keeping in \\nmind our Government\\x92s firm and irrevocable commitment to implement the National Food \\nSecurity Act throughout the country. \\nDefence \\n\\n55. The allocation for defence has been enhanced by 10 percent from `203,672 crore in \\nBE 2013-14 to `224,000 crore in 2014-15. \\nOne Rank One Pension \\n\\n56. Hon\\x92ble Members are aware of the long standing demand of the Defence Services for \\nOne Rank One Pension (OROP). It is an emotive issue, it has legal implications, and it has to \\nbe handled with great sensitivity. During the tenure of the UPA Governments, changes in \\nthe pension rules applicable to the defence services were notified on three occasions in 2006, \\n2010 and 2013. As a result, the gap between pre-2006 retirees and post-2006 retirees has \\nbeen closed in four ranks (subject to some anomalies that are being addressed): Havildar, \\nNaib Subedar, Subedar and Subedar Major. There is still a small gap in the ranks of Sepoy \\nand Naik and a gap in the ranks of Major and above. We need a young fighting force, we \\nneed young jawans, and we need young officers. We also need to take care of those who \\nserved in the defence forces only for a limited number of years. Government has therefore \\ndecided to walk the last mile and close the gap for all retirees in all ranks. I am happy to \\nannounce that Government has accepted the principle of One Rank One Pension for the \\n\\x0c\\ndefence forces. This decision will be implemented prospectively from the financial year \\n2014-15. The requirement for 2014-15 is estimated at `500 crore and, as an earnest of the \\nUPA Government\\x92s commitment, I propose to transfer a sum of `500 crore to the Defence \\nPension Account in the current financial year itself. \\n\\nCentral Armed Police Forces \\n\\n57. A modernisation plan at a cost of `11,009 crore has been approved to strengthen the \\ncapacity of Central Armed Police Forces and to provide them state-of-the-art equipment and \\ntechnology. Funds have been provided in the current financial year and for the next year. \\nFINANCIAL SECTOR \\nBanking \\n\\n58. Hon\\x92ble Members, the announcements that I made concerning the financial sector in \\nthe Budget speech of February 2013 have been, or are being, implemented. In 2014-15, I \\npropose to provide `11,200 crore for capital infusion in public sector banks. They have \\nopened 5,207 branches so far, against the target of 8,023 branches, and are near the goal of \\ninstalling an ATM at every branch. The Bharatiya Mahila Bank was inaugurated on \\n19.11.2013. `6,000 crore was provided to the Rural Housing Fund and `2,000 crore to the \\nUrban Housing Fund. \\n59. Banks are under strain owing to rising non-performing assets. Bankers have assured \\nme that as the economy turns they will be able to contain the NPAs, recover more loans, and \\nbuild healthier balance sheets. \\n60. Meanwhile, I cannot fail to acknowledge the yeomen service rendered by our banks in \\nreaching Government\\x92s policies and programmes to the people. This year, banks will exceed \\nthe target of `700,000 crore of agricultural credit. I am therefore encouraged to set a target of \\n`800,000 crore for 2014-15. Hon\\x92ble Members will recall that an interest subvention scheme \\nwas introduced in 2006-07. There is a subvention of 2 percent and an incentive of 3 percent \\nfor prompt payment, thus reducing the effective rate of interest on farm loans to \\n4 percent. So far, `23,924 crore has been released under the scheme. I propose to continue \\nthe scheme in 2014-15. \\nCredit to Minority Communities \\n\\n61. Ten years ago, the minorities had 14,15,000 bank accounts in 121 districts of India \\nwhere there is a concentration of minorities. At the end of March, 2013, they had 43,52,000 \\naccounts and the volume of lending had soared from `4,000 crore to `66,500 crore. Loans to \\nminority communities in the whole country stood at `211,451 crore at the end of December \\n2013. \\nSelf Help Groups \\n\\n62. Ten years ago, only 9,71,182 women Self-Help Groups had been credit linked to \\nbanks. At the end of December 2013, 41,16,000 women SHGs had been provided credit and \\nthe outstanding amount of credit was `36,893 crore. \\n\\x0c\\nEducation Loans \\n\\n63. Ten years ago, only a few thousand students \\x96 mostly the well-connected \\x96 got \\neducation loans. At the end of December 2013, public sector banks had 25,70,254 student \\nloan accounts and the amount outstanding was `57,700 crore. \\n64. Hon\\x92ble Members will recall that my predecessor, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, had, in the \\nBudget of 2009-10, introduced the Central Scheme for Interest Subsidy (CSIS) in respect of \\neducation loans disbursed after 1.4.2009 under which Government took over the burden of \\ninterest for the duration of the period of study and a little beyond. The scheme brought great \\ncheer to student-borrowers and their families. However, I have noticed a sense of \\ndiscrimination among students who had borrowed before 31.3.2009, struggled to pay interest \\nduring the period of study, and continued to service the loans afterwards. I think they deserve \\nsome relief. I therefore propose a moratorium period for all education loans taken up to \\n31.3.2009 and outstanding on 31.12.2013. Government will take over the liability for \\noutstanding interest as on 31.12.2013, but the borrower would have to pay interest for the \\nperiod after 1.1.2014. It is estimated that nearly 9 lakh student borrowers will benefit to the \\ntune of approximately `2,600 crore. I intend to provide the funds in the current financial year \\nitself. Accordingly, a sum of `2,600 crore will be transferred to the Canara Bank, the \\ndesignated CSIS banker. Details of the scheme will be announced shortly. \\nInsurance \\n\\n65. This year, Life Insurance Corporation has opened 1,252 offices and the four public \\nsector general insurance companies have opened 1,849 offices in towns with a population of \\n10,000 or more to serve peri-urban and rural areas. They are moving steadily to achieve the \\ngoals set for them. \\nFinancial Markets \\n\\n66. A number of steps have been envisaged to deepen the Indian financial markets. \\nAmong them are \\n\\x95 To comprehensively revamp the ADR/GDR scheme and enlarge the scope of \\nDepository Receipts; \\n\\x95 To liberalise the rupee-denominated corporate bond market; \\n\\x95 To deepen and strengthen the currency derivatives market to enable Indian \\ncompanies to fully hedge against foreign currency risks; \\n\\x95 To create one record for all financial assets of every individual; \\n\\x95 To enable smoother clearing and settlement for international investors looking \\nto invest in Indian bonds. \\nCommodity Derivatives Market \\n\\n67. Hon\\x92ble Members will recall the payment crisis in the National Spot Exchange \\nLimited (NSEL). Following the transfer of the subject to the Ministry of Finance, swift \\naction was taken to sequester NSEL and to ensure there was no spill over of the crisis to the \\nother regulated segments of the financial market. I propose to amend the Forward Contracts \\n(Regulation) Act to strengthen the regulatory framework of the commodity derivatives \\nmarket. \\n\\x0c\\nKey Pending Bills \\n\\n68. I regret to record my disappointment that the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill and \\nthe Securities Laws (Amendment) Bill have not been passed by Parliament for reasons that \\nhave nothing to do with the merits of the Bills. \\nPublic Debt Management Agency \\n\\n69. Pursuant to the announcement in the Budget speech of 2011-12, Government is ready \\nwith the Public Debt Management Agency Bill. Following precedent, it is proposed to \\nestablish a non-statutory PDMA that can begin work in 2014-15. \\nA VISION FOR THE FUTURE \\n\\n70. Madam Speaker, I now wish to look forward and outline a vision for the future. \\n71. I wonder how many have noted the fact that India\\x92s economy, in terms of the size of \\nits GDP, is the 11th largest in the world. There are great things in store. There is a well-\\nargued view that in the next three decades India\\x92s nominal GDP will take the country to the \\nthird rank after the US and China. Just as the fortunes of the developed countries affect the \\nemerging economies today, the fortunes of China and India will, in the future, have a \\nsignificant impact on the rest of the world. We therefore owe a responsibility not only to \\nourselves but to the whole world to keep our economy in robust health. \\n72. The UPA Government has a clear line of sight to the goals that we have set for \\nourselves. I have broken down the steps toward those goals into tasks that must be \\nundertaken by the Government of the day. I crave your leave to identify ten such tasks: \\ni. Fiscal Consolidation: We must achieve the target of fiscal deficit of 3 percent \\nof GDP by 2016-17, and remain below that level always. \\nii. Current Account Deficit: Since we will run a Current Account Deficit every \\nyear for some more years, it can be financed only by foreign investment, \\nwhether it is FDI or FII or ECB or any other kind of foreign inflow. Hence, \\nthere is no room for any aversion to foreign investment. \\niii. Price Stability and Growth: In a developing economy we must accept that when \\nour aim is high growth there will be a moderate level of inflation. RBI must \\nstrike a balance between price stability and growth while formulating monetary \\npolicy. \\niv. Financial Sector Reforms: The recommendations of the Financial Sector \\nLegislative Reforms Commission that require no change in legislation must be \\nimplemented immediately and, for the other recommendations, we must draw a \\ntimetable for passing legislation. \\nv. Infrastructure: We must rebuild our infrastructure and add a huge quantity of \\nnew infrastructure. Every proven model must be adopted and the PPP model \\nmust be more widely used. New financing structures must be created for long \\nterm funds and pooling of investments. \\nvi. Manufacturing: We must focus on manufacturing and especially on \\nmanufacturing for export. I propose that all taxes, Central and State, that go \\ninto an exported product should be waived or rebated. I also propose that there \\n\\x0c\\nshould be a minimum tariff protection so that there is an incentive to \\nmanufacture goods in India rather than import them into India. \\n\\nvii. Subsidies: Given the limited resources, and the many claims on the resources, \\nwe must choose the subsidies that are absolutely necessary and give them only \\nto the absolutely deserving. \\nviii. Urbanisation: Our cities will become ungovernable, and perhaps unliveable, if \\nwe do not address the decay in our cities. Cities have wealth, cities also create \\nwealth. That wealth should be tapped for resources to rebuild the cities with a \\nnew model of governance. \\nix. Skill Development: Skill development must rank alongside secondary \\neducation, university education, total sanitation and universal health care in the \\npriorities of the Government. \\nx. Sharing responsibility between States and Centre: States have the fiscal space \\nto bear a reasonable proportion of the financial costs of implementing flagship \\nprogrammes and must willingly do so, so that the Central Government can \\nallocate more resources for subjects such as defence, railways, national \\nhighways and telecommunications that are its exclusive responsibility. \\nREVENUES \\nGST and DTC \\n\\n73. Revenues are of paramount importance. The best source of revenue is taxes and for \\nthat we need modern tax laws. I am disappointed that we have not yet been able to introduce \\nGST. I leave it to you to answer the question, who blocked the GST when an agreement on \\nthe game-changing tax reform was around the corner? We have also got ready a Direct Taxes \\nCode that will serve us for at least the next twenty years. I intend to place it on the website \\nfor a public discussion without partisanship or acrimony. I appeal to all political parties to \\nresolve to pass the GST laws and the DTC in 2014-15. \\nFunding Scientific Research \\n\\n74. Our Government has passionately espoused the cause of science, promoted scientific \\nresearch, and supported scientific applications and inventions. The Income-tax Act allows \\ndeductions for expenditure on scientific research, but it is limited to direct funding. We have \\nreflected on a new approach to funding scientific research. I therefore propose to set up a \\nResearch Funding Organisation that will fund research projects selected through a \\ncompetitive process. Contributions to that organisation will be eligible for tax benefits. This \\nwill require legislative changes which can be introduced at the time of the regular Budget. \\nOff-shore Accounts \\n\\n75. There has been much debate on illegal off-shore accounts held by Indians. \\nInvestigations into such accounts were launched in 2011. Despite several hurdles in \\nobtaining evidence from the countries concerned, the Government has succeeded, through \\nalternative methods and special efforts, in obtaining information in 67 cases and action is \\nunderway to determine the tax liability as well as impose penalty. Prosecutions for wilful tax \\nevasion have been launched in 17 other cases. More enquiries have been initiated into \\naccounts reportedly held by Indian entities in no tax or low tax jurisdictions. \\n\\x0c\\nChanges in Tax Rates \\n\\n76. In keeping with the conventions, I do not propose to make any announcements \\nregarding changes to the tax laws. However, the current economic situation demands some \\ninterventions that cannot wait for the regular Budget. In particular, the manufacturing sector \\nneeds an immediate boost. Hence, I propose the following changes in some indirect tax rates: \\n(i) To stimulate growth in the capital goods and consumer non-durables, I propose \\nto reduce the excise duty from 12 percent to 10 percent on all goods falling \\nunder chapter 84 and chapter 85 of the Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff \\nAct for the period up to 30.6.2014. The rates can be reviewed at the time of the \\nregular Budget. \\n(ii) To give relief to the automobile industry which is registering unprecedented \\nnegative growth, I propose to reduce the excise duty as follows for the period \\nup to 30.6.2014: \\nSmall cars, motor cycles, scooters \\nand commercial vehicles } from 12% to 8% \\nSUVs } from 30% to 24% \\nLarge and mid-segment cars } from 27/24% to 24/20% \\n\\nConsequently, I propose to make appropriate reductions in the excise duty on \\nchassis and trailers. \\n\\nThe rates can be reviewed at the time of the regular Budget. \\n\\n(iii) To encourage domestic production of mobile handsets (which has declined) and \\nreduce the dependence on imports (which have increased), I propose to \\nrestructure the excise duties for all categories of mobile handsets. The rates will \\nbe 6 percent with CENVAT credit or 1 percent without CENVAT credit. \\n(iv) To encourage domestic production of soaps and oleo chemicals, \\nI propose to rationalise the customs duty structure on non-edible grade \\nindustrial oils and its fractions, fatty acids and fatty alcohols at 7.5 percent. \\n(v) To encourage domestic production of specified road construction machinery, I \\npropose to withdraw the exemption from CVD on similar imported machinery. \\n(vi) To encourage indigenous production of security paper for printing currency \\nnotes, I propose to provide a concessional customs duty of 5 percent on capital \\ngoods imported by the Bank Note Paper Mill India Private Limited. \\n77. I also propose to give relief from service tax in two cases. \\n(i) By virtue of the definition of \\x91agricultural produce\\x92 in Finance Act 2012, read \\nwith the Negative List, storage or warehousing of paddy was excluded from the \\nlevy of service tax. Rice was not. The distinction is somewhat artificial. Hence, \\nI propose to exempt loading, unloading, packing, storage and warehousing of \\nrice from service tax. \\n(ii) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has requested that services provided by \\ncord blood banks are also healthcare services and should be exempt from \\nservice tax. I propose to accept the request. \\nNotifications in respect of the above changes will be issued today. \\n\\n\\x0c\\nBUDGET ESTIMATES \\n\\n78. I shall now present the Budget Estimates for 2014-15. \\n79. The current financial year will end on a satisfactory note with the fiscal deficit at 4.6 \\npercent (below the red line of 4.8 percent) and the revenue deficit at 3.3 percent. \\n80. Emboldened by the progress made, I have budgeted for receipts and expenditure in \\n2014-15 that will leave a fiscal deficit of 4.1 percent, which will be below the target set by \\nthe new fiscal consolidation path. Revenue deficit is estimated at 3.0 percent. \\n81. The estimate of plan expenditure is `555,322 crore. Non-plan expenditure is \\nestimated at `12,07,892 crore. \\nConclusion \\n\\n82. Madam Speaker, Jean Drèze and Amartya Sen have pointed out that \\x93India was the \\nfirst non-Western country \\x96 and also the first poor country in the world \\x96 to commit itself to a \\nresolutely democratic way of governance.\\x94 Democracy acknowledges diversity, respects \\ndissent, encourages debate, and decides through a government of elected representatives. \\nNeither populism nor majoritarianism nor individualism is an alternative way of governance. \\n83. Our way of governance has not come in the way of lifting 140 million people out of \\npoverty in the last ten years. That is the greatest achievement of the UPA Governments, and \\nwe are proud of the achievement. \\n84. In the ten years that I have been in the North Block, I have seen the best of times and \\ndifficult times. Never did I lose faith in Jawaharlal Nehru\\x92s idea of India that, in the words of \\nSunil Khilnani, \\x93sought to coordinate within the form of a modern state a variety of values: \\ndemocracy, religious tolerance, economic development and cultural pluralism.\\x94 It is with \\nthat faith that I shall remain on the bridge until the day when, I am sure, the people of India \\nwill entrust the responsibility to a hand that will hold the \\x93sceptre swayed with equity.\\x94 Let \\nme sign off with the couplet from the sage, Thiruvalluvar: \\n\\x93Vel Anru Venri Tharuvathu Mannavan \\nKol Athuvoom Kodaathu Enin.\\x94 \\n\\n(Not the spear but sceptre swayed with equity \\nAlone gives the ruler victory.) \\n\\n85. Madam Speaker, with these words I commend the Interim Budget to the House.'"

              "'Budget  2010-2011\\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech  of\\n\\nPranab Mukherjee\\n\\nMinister of Finance\\n\\n \\n\\nFebruary  26,  2010\\n\\n \\n\\nMadam Speaker,\\n\\n            I rise to present the Union Budget for 2010-11.\\n\\n            In 2009, when I presented the interim Budget in February and the regular Budget in July in this august House, the Indian economy was facing grave uncertainties. Growth had started decelerating and the business sentiment was weak. The economy is capacity to sustain high growth was under serious threat from the widespread economic slowdown in the developed world.\\n\\n2.          It was not clear to us, as also to the policy makers in many other countries, how this crisis would eventually unfold. What would be its impact on the growth momentum of the Indian economy?  How soon will we be able to turnaround the fortunes of our economy? The short term global outlook was bleak and the consensus was that year 2009 would face the brunt of this crisis across the world.\\n\\n3.          At home, there was added uncertainty on account of the delayed and sub-normal south-west monsoon, which had undermined the kharif crop in the country.  There were concerns about production and prices of food items and its possible repercussions on the growth of rural demand.\\n\\n4.          Today, as I stand before you, I can say with confidence that we have weathered these crises well. Indian economy now is in a far better position than it was a year ago. That is not to say that the challenges today are any less than what they were nine months ago when UPA under the leadership of Mrs Sonia Gandhi was elected back to power and Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh formed the Government for the second term.\\n\\n5.          The three challenges and the medium term perspective that I had outlined in my last Budget Speech remain relevant, even today. These would continue to engage the Indian policy-planners for the next few years.\\n\\n6.          The first challenge before us is to quickly revert to the high GDP growth path of 9 per cent and then find the means to cross the  wouldouble digit growth barrier\\'. This calls for imparting a fresh momentum to the impressive recovery in growth witnessed in the past few months. In this endeavour, I seek Lord Indra is help to make the recovery more broad-based in the coming months.\\n\\n7.          Growth is only as important as what it enables us to do and be. Therefore, the second challenge is to harness economic growth to consolidate the recent gains in making development more inclusive. The thrust imparted to the development of infrastructure in rural areas has to be pursued to achieve the desired objectives within a fixed time frame.\\n\\n8.          We have to strengthen food security, improve education opportunities and provide health facilities at the level of households, both in rural and urban areas. These are issues that require significant resources, and we have to find those resources.\\n\\n9.          The third challenge relates to the weaknesses in government systems, structures and institutions at different levels of governance. Indeed, in the coming years, if there is one factor that can hold us back in realising our potential as a modern nation, it is the bottleneck of our public delivery mechanisms. There have been many initiatives in this regard, in different sectors, at different points of time. Some of them have been effective in reforming the way the Government works in those areas. But we have a long way to go before we can rest on this count.\\n\\n10.        The Union Budget cannot be a mere statement of Government accounts. It has to reflect the Government is vision and signal the policies to come in future.\\n\\n11.        With development and economic reforms, the focus of economic activity has shifted towards the non-governmental actors, bringing into sharper focus the role of Government as an enabler.\\n\\n12.        An enabling Government does not try to deliver directly to the citizens everything that they need. Instead it creates an enabling ethos so that individual enterprise and creativity can flourish. Government concentrates on supporting and delivering services to the disadvantaged sections of the society.\\n\\n13.        It is this broad conceptualisation of the Budget that informs my speech today. I would now begin by presenting a brief overview of the economy.\\n\\nOverview of the Economy\\n\\n14.        Yesterday, I laid on the table of the House the Economic Survey, which gives a detailed analysis of the economic situation of the country over the past twelve months.  I intend to highlight only a few salient features that form the backdrop of this Budget.\\n\\n15.        The fiscal year 2009-10 was a challenging year for the Indian economy. The significant deceleration in the second half of 2008-09, brought the real GDP growth down to 6.7 per cent, from an average of over 9 per cent in the preceding three years. We were among the first few countries in the world to implement a broad-based counter-cyclic policy package to respond to the negative fallout of the global slowdown. It included a substantial fiscal expansion along with liberal monetary policy support.\\n\\n16.        The effectiveness of these policy measures became evident with fast paced recovery. The economy stabilised in the first quarter of 2009-10 itself, when it clocked a GDP growth of 6.1 per cent, as against 5.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of the preceding year. It registered a strong rebound in the second quarter, when the growth rate rose to 7.9 per cent. With the Advance Estimates placing the likely growth for 2009-10 at 7.2 per cent, we are indeed vindicated in our policy stand. The final figure may well turn out to be higher when the third and fourth quarter GDP estimates for 2009-10 become available.\\n\\n17.        This recovery is very encouraging for it has come about despite a negative growth in the agriculture sector.  More importantly, it is the result of a renewed momentum in the manufacturing sector and marks the rise of this sector as the growth driver of the economy. The growth rate in manufacturing in December 2009 was 18.5 per centâ\\x80\\x94 the highest in the past two decades. There are also signs of a turnaround in the merchandise exports with a positive growth in November and December 2009 after a decline of about twelve successive months. Export figures for January are also encouraging.  Significant private investment can now be expected to provide the engine for sustaining a growth of 9 per cent per annum. With some luck, I hope to breach the 10 per cent mark in not-too-distant a future.\\n\\n18.        A major concern during the second half of 2009-10 has been the emergence of double digit food inflation. There was a momentum in food prices since the flare-up of global commodity prices preceding the financial crisis in 2008, but it was expected that the agriculture season beginning June 2009 would help in moderating the food inflation. However, the erratic monsoons and drought like conditions in large parts of the country reinforced the supply side bottlenecks in some of the essential commodities. This set in motion inflationary expectations. Since December 2009, there have been indications of these high food prices, together with the gradual hardening of the fuel product prices, getting transmitted to other non-food items as well. The inflation data for January seems to have confirmed this trend.\\n\\n19.        Government is acutely conscious of this situation and has set in motion steps, in consultation with the State Chief Ministers, which should bring down the inflation in the next few months and ensure that there is better management of food security in the country.\\n\\nCONSOLIDATING  GROWTH\\n\\n20.       Managing a complex economy is a difficult task, more so when it is a growing economy in a globalised world. And yet, choices have to be made and they have to be well-timed.\\n\\n21.        After successfully managing the effects of the global slowdown, we need to strengthen the domestic macroeconomic environment to help consolidate the rebound in growth and sustain it over the medium term. We need to review the stimulus imparted to the economy and move towards the preferred path of fiscal consolidation that facilitated the remarkable growth in the pre-crisis five year period.  We need to make growth more broad-based and ensure that supply-demand imbalances are better managed.\\n\\nFiscal Consolidation\\n\\n22.        The success of the fiscal stimulus in supporting domestic demand could be traced to its composition. The approach of the Government was to increase the disposable income in the hands of the people by effecting reductions in indirect taxes and by expanding public expenditure on programmes like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and rural infrastructure. Now that the recovery has taken root, there is a need to review public spending, mobilise resources and gear them towards building the productivity of the economy.\\n\\n23.        In shaping the fiscal policy for 2010-11, I have acted on the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission. It has recommended a calibrated exit strategy from the expansionary fiscal stance of last two years. The Commission has recommended a capping of the combined debt of the Centre and the States at 68 per cent of the GDP to be achieved by 2014-15.\\n\\n24.        As a part of the fiscal consolidation process, it would be for the first time that the Government would target an explicit reduction in its domestic public debt-GDP ratio. I intend to bring out, within six months, a status paper giving a detailed analysis of the situation and a road map for curtailing the overall public debt. This would be followed by an annual report on the subject.\\n\\nTax reforms\\n\\n25.        I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that the process for building a simple tax system with minimum exemptions and low rates designed to promote voluntary compliance, is now nearing completion. On the Direct Tax Code the wide-ranging discussions with stakeholders have been concluded.  I am confident that the Government will be in a position to implement the Direct Tax Code from April 1, 2011.\\n\\n26.        On Goods and Services Tax, we have been focusing on generating a wide consensus on its design. In November, 2009 the Empowered Committee of the State Finance Ministers placed the first discussion paper on GST in the public domain. The Thirteenth Finance Commission has also made a number of significant recommendations relating to GST, which will contribute to the ongoing discussions. We are actively engaged with the Empowered Committee to finalise the structure of GST as well as the modalities of its expeditious implementation. It will be my earnest endeavour to introduce GST along with the DTC in April, 2011.\\n\\nPeople is ownership of PSUs\\n\\n27.        While presenting the Budget for 2009-10, I invited people to participate in Government is disinvestment programme to share in the wealth and prosperity of the Central Public Sector Undertakings.\\n\\n28.        Since then, ownership has been broad based in Oil India Limited, NHPC, NTPC and Rural Electrification Corporation while the process is on for National Mineral Development Corporation and Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam. The Government will raise about Rs.25,000 crore during the current year. Through this process, I propose to raise a higher amount during the year 2010-11. The proceeds will be utilised to meet the capital expenditure requirements of social sector schemes for creating new assets.\\n\\n29.        Listing of Central Public Sector Undertakings improves corporate governance, besides unlocking the value for all stakeholdersâ\\x80\\x94the government, the company and the shareholders. Market capitalization of five companies which have been listed since October, 2004 has increased by 3.8 times from the book value of Rs.78,841 crore to Rs.2,98,929 crore.\\n\\n30.        The effective management of public expenditure by bringing it in line with the Government is objectives is a part of the fiscal consolidation process. This calls for proper targeting of subsidies and expenditure adjustment.\\n\\nFertiliser subsidy\\n\\n31.        I had announced the intent of the Government for the fertiliser sector in my Budget Speech of 2009. A Nutrient Based Subsidy policy for the fertiliser sector has since been approved by the Government and will become effective from April 1, 2010. This policy is expected to promote balanced fertilization through new fortified products and focus on extension services by the fertiliser industry. This will lead to an increase in agricultural productivity and consequently better returns for the farmers. Over time, the policy is expected to reduce volatility in the demand for fertiliser subsidy in addition to containing the subsidy bill. Government will ensure that nutrient based fertiliser prices for transition year 2010-11, will remain around MRPs currently prevailing. The new system will move towards direct transfer of subsidies to the farmers.\\n\\nPetroleum and Diesel pricing policy\\n\\n32.        In the last Budget, the constitution of an Expert Group, to advise the Government on a viable and sustainable system of pricing of petroleum products, was announced.  The Group headed by Shri Kirit Parikh has submitted its recommendations to the Government.  Decision on these recommendations will be taken by my colleague, the Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas, in due course.\\n\\n33.        I am very happy to inform the Honourable Members that we have not only adhered to the fiscal roadmap that I had presented as a part of the Budget documents last year, but we have improved upon it. Except for meeting the liabilities of the year 2008-09, we have not issued oil or fertiliser bonds. I shall come to the numbers when I refer to the budget estimates a little later.\\n\\nImproving Investment Environment\\n\\nForeign Direct Investment\\n\\n34.        Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows during the year have been steady in spite of the decline in global capital flows. India received FDI equity inflows of US$ 20.9 billion during April-December, 2009 compared to US$ 21.1 billion during the same period last year.\\n\\n35.        Government has taken a number of steps to simplify the FDI regime to make it easily comprehensible to foreign investors. For the first time, both ownership and control have been recognised as central to the FDI policy, and methodology for calculation of indirect foreign investment in Indian companies has been clearly defined. A consistent policy on downstream investment has also been formulated. Another major initiative has been the complete liberalization of pricing and payment of technology transfer fee, trademark, brand name and royalty payments. These payments can now be made under the automatic route.\\n\\n36.        Government also intends to make the FDI policy user-friendly by consolidating all prior regulations and guidelines into one comprehensive document. This would enhance clarity and predictability of our FDI policy to foreign investors.\\n\\nFinancial Stability and Development Council\\n\\n37.        The financial crisis of 2008-09 has fundamentally changed the structure of banking and financial markets the world over. With a view to strengthen and institutionalise the mechanism for maintaining financial stability, Government has decided to setup an apex-level Financial Stability and Development Council. Without prejudice to the autonomy of regulators, this Council would monitor macro prudential supervision of the economy, including the functioning of large financial conglomerates, and address inter-regulatory coordination issues. It will also focus on financial literacy and financial inclusion.\\n\\nBanking Licences\\n\\n38.        The Indian banking system has emerged unscathed from the crisis. We need to ensure that the banking system grows in size and sophistication to meet the needs of a modern economy. Besides, there is a need to extend the geographic coverage of banks and improve access to banking services. In this context, I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that the RBI is considering giving some additional banking licenses to private sector players. Non Banking Financial Companies could also be considered, if they meet the RBI is eligibility criteria.\\n\\nPublic Sector Bank Capitalisation\\n\\n39.        During 2008-09, the Government infused Rs.1900 crore as Tier-I capital in four public sector banks to maintain a comfortable level of Capital to Risk Weighted Asset Ratio. An additional sum of Rs.1200 crore is being infused now. For the year 2010-11, I propose to provide a sum of Rs.16,500 crore to ensure that the Public Sector Banks are able to attain a minimum 8 per cent Tier-I capital by March 31, 2011.\\n\\nRecapitalisation of Regional Rural Banks\\n\\n40.        Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) play an important role in providing credit to rural economy. The capital of these banks is shared by the Central Government, sponsor banks and State Governments. The banks were last capitalised in\\n2006-07. I propose to provide further capital to strengthen the RRBs so that they have adequate capital base to support increased lending to the rural economy.\\n\\nCorporate Governance\\n\\n41.        Improvement in corporate governance and regulation is an important part of the overall investment environment in the country. Government has introduced the Companies Bill, 2009 in the Parliament, which will replace the existing Companies Act, 1956. The proposed new bill will address issues related to regulation in corporate sector in the context of the changing business environment.\\n\\nExports\\n\\n42.        Government has provided interest subvention of 2 per cent on pre-shipment export credit up to March 31, 2010 for exports in certain sectors. I propose to extend the interest subvention of 2 per cent for one more year for exports covering handicrafts, carpets, handlooms and small and medium enterprises.\\n\\nSpecial Economic Zones (SEZs)\\n\\n43.        The SEZs have attracted significant flows of domestic and foreign investments. In first three quarters of 2009-10 exports from SEZs recorded a growth of 127 per cent over the corresponding period last year. Government is committed to ensuring continued growth of SEZs to draw investments and boost exports and employment.\\n\\nAgriculture Growth\\n\\n44.        The agriculture sector occupies centre-stage in our resolve to promote inclusive growth, enhance rural incomes and sustain food security. To spur the growth in this sector, the Government intends to follow a four-pronged strategy covering (a) agricultural production; (b) reduction in wastage of produce;\\n(c) credit support to farmers; and (d) a thrust to the food processing sector.\\n\\n45.        The first element of the strategy is to extend the green revolution to the eastern region of the country comprising Bihar, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Eastern UP, West Bengal and Orissa, with the active involvement of Gram Sabhas and the farming families. For the year 2010-11, I propose to provide Rs.400 crore for this initiative.\\n\\n46.        In the 60th year of the Republic, it is proposed to organise 60,000 \"pulses and oil seed villages\" in rain-fed areas during 2010-11 and provide an integrated intervention for water harvesting, watershed management and soil health, to enhance the productivity of the dry land farming areas.  I propose to provide Rs.300 crore for this purpose. This initiative will be an integral part of the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana.\\n\\n47.        The gains already made in the green revolution areas have to be sustained through conservation farming, which involves concurrent attention to soil health, water conservation and preservation of biodiversity.  I propose an allocation of Rs.200 crore for launching this climate resilient agriculture initiative.\\n\\n48.        The second element of the strategy relates to reduction of significant wastages in storage as well as in the operations of the existing food supply chains in the country. This needs to be addressed. As the Prime Minister has said recently, \"We need greater competition and therefore need to take a firm view on opening up of the retail trade.\"  It will help in bringing down the considerable difference between the farm gate prices, wholesale prices and retail prices.\\n\\n49.        There is wastage of grain procured for buffer stocks and public distribution system due to acute shortage of storage capacity in the Food Corporation of India. This deficit in the storage capacity is met through an ongoing scheme for private sector participation where the FCI has been hiring godowns from private parties for a guaranteed period of 5 years. This period is now being extended to 7 years.\\n\\n50.        The third element of the strategy relates to improving the availability of credit to farmers.   I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that banks have been consistently meeting the targets set for agriculture credit flow in the past few years. For the year 2010-11, the target has been raised to Rs.3,75,000 crore from Rs.3,25,000 crore in the current year.\\n\\n51.        The Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme for Farmers was a major initiative of the UPA Government. In view of the recent drought in some States and the severe floods in some other parts of the country, I propose to extend by six months the period for repayment of the loan amount by farmers from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2010.\\n\\n52.        In the last budget, I had provided an additional one per cent interest subvention as an incentive to those farmers who repay their short-term crop loans as per schedule. I propose to raise this subvention for timely repayment of crop loans from one per cent to two per cent for 2010-11. Thus, the effective rate of interest for such farmers will now be five per cent per annum. Necessary provision in the Budget has been made.\\n\\n53.       The fourth element of the strategy aims at lending a further impetus to the development of food processing sector by providing state-of-the art infrastructure.  In addition to the ten mega food park projects already being set up, the Government has decided to set up five more such parks.\\n\\n54.        As a part of the farm to market initiative, External Commercial Borrowings will henceforth be available for cold storage or cold room facility, including for farm level pre-cooling, for preservation or storage of agricultural and allied produce, marine products and meat. Changes in the definition of infrastructure under the ECB policy are being made.\\n\\nInfrastructure\\n\\n55.        Accelerated development of high quality physical infrastructure, such as roads, ports, airports and railways is essential to sustain economic growth. While addressing the policy gaps in this sector, I propose to maintain the thrust for upgrading infrastructure in both rural and urban areas. In the Budget for\\n2010-11, I have provided Rs.1,73,552 crore, which accounts for over 46 per cent of the total plan allocations, for infrastructure development in the country.\\n\\n56.        To make a visible impact in the road sector, Government has targeted construction of national highways (NHs) at the pace of 20 km per day.  To push the pace of implementation, changes have been made in the policy framework, especially in respect of projects being executed through public private partnerships (PPPs). For the year 2010-11, I propose to raise the allocation of road transport by over 13 per cent from Rs.17,520 crore to Rs.19,894 crore.\\n\\n57.        Honourable Members have already heard from the Railway Minister about the large investments required to modernise and expand the network. I have provided Rs.16,752 crore in the Budget for 2010-11 for Railways to lend her a helping hand. This is about Rs.950 crore more than last year, when a substantial increase was made in the budgetary support for Railways.\\n\\n58.        To complement the dedicated freight corridor, the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor project has been taken up for integrated regional development. Preparatory activities have been completed for creation of six industrial investment nodes with eco-friendly world class infrastructure.\\n\\nIndia Infrastructure Finance Company Limited\\n\\n59.        Government established the India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) to provide long term financial assistance to infrastructure projects. Its disbursements are expected to touch Rs.9,000 crore by end March 2010 and reach around Rs.20,000 crore by March 2011. IIFCL has also been authorised to refinance bank lending to infrastructure projects. It has refinanced Rs.3,000 crore during the current year and is expected to more than double that amount in 2010-11. The take-out financing scheme announced in the last Budget is expected to initially provide finance for about Rs.25,000 crore in the next three years.\\n\\nEnergy\\n\\n60.        Government accords the highest priority to capacity addition in the power sector. The framework for induction of super critical technology in large capacity power plants of National Thermal Power Corporation is now in place.  The Mega Power Policy has been modified and is now consistent with the National Electricity Policy, 2005 and Tariff Policy, 2006. It will help in lowering the cost of generation and the cost of power purchased by distribution utilities. I have more than doubled the plan allocation for power sector from Rs.2,230 crore in 2009-10 to Rs.5,130 crore in 2010-11. This does not include allocations for RGGVY, which is a part of Bharat Nirman.\\n\\n61.        Coal is the mainstay of India is energy sector and 75 per cent of the power generation is currently coal based. It is proposed to introduce a competitive bidding process for allocating coal blocks for captive mining to ensure greater transparency and increased participation in production from these blocks.\\n\\n62.        Government proposes to take steps to set up a \"Coal Regulatory Authority\" to create a level playing field in the coal sector. This would facilitate resolution of issues like economic pricing of coal and benchmarking of standards of performance. \\n\\n63.        The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission envisages establishing India as a global leader in solar energy.  An ambitious target of 20,000 MW of solar power by the year 2022 has been set under the mission. I propose to increase the plan outlay for the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy by 61 per cent from Rs.620 crore in 2009-10 to Rs.1,000 crore in 2010-11.\\n\\n64.        The Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir faces an extremely harsh climate and suffers from energy deficiency. To address this problem, it is proposed to set up solar, small hydro and micro power projects at a cost of about Rs.500 crore.\\n\\nEnvironment and Climate change\\n\\n65.        To ameliorate the negative environmental consequences and increased pollution levels associated with industrialisation and urbanisation, I propose to take a number of proactive steps in the Budget 2010-11.\\n\\nNational Clean Energy Fund (NCEF)\\n\\n66.        There are many areas of the country where pollution levels have reached alarming proportions. While we must ensure that the principle of \"polluter pays\" remains the basic guiding criteria for pollution management, we must also give a positive thrust to development of clean energy. I propose to establish a National Clean Energy Fund for funding research and innovative projects in clean energy technologies. I shall outline the mode of funding for this initiative in Part B of my speech.\\n\\nEffluent Treatment Plant, Tirupur\\n\\n67.       The textile cluster for knitwear in Tirupur in Tamil Nadu is a major contributor to the country is hosiery exports. I propose to provide a one-time grant of Rs.200 crore to the Government of Tamil Nadu towards the cost of installation of a zero liquid discharge system at Tirupur to sustain this industry, which provides livelihood to lakhs of persons, without undermining the environment.\\n\\nSpecial Golden Jubilee Package for Goa\\n\\n68.        I propose to provide a sum of Rs.200 crore as a Special Golden Jubilee package for Goa to preserve the natural resources of the State by restoring Goa is beaches which are prone to erosion, and increasing its green cover through sustainable forestry.\\n\\nNational Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA)\\n\\n69.        The \"Mission Clean Ganga 2020\" under the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) with the objective that no untreated municipal sewage or industrial effluent will be discharged into the national river has already been initiated. I propose to double the allocation for NGRBA in 2010-11 to Rs.500 crore.\\n\\n70.        I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that schemes on bank protection works along river Bhagirathi and river Ganga-Padma in parts of Murshidabad and Nadia district of West Bengal have been included in the Centrally Sponsored Flood Management Programme. I also propose to provide budgetary support for drainage scheme of Kaliaghai-Kapaleswari Baghai basin in the district of Purba and Paschim Midnapore, and Master Plan of Kandi sub-division in Murshidabad, West Bengal.\\n\\n71.        Recognising the need for developing an alternate port facility in West Bengal, it is proposed to develop a project at Sagar Island. Necessary funds will be provided in due course.\\n\\nINCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT\\n\\n72.        For the UPA Government, inclusive development is an act of faith. In the last five years, our Government has created entitlements backed by legal guarantees for an individual is right to information and her right to work. This has been followed-up with the enactment of the right to education in 2009-10. As the next step, we are now ready with the draft Food Security Bill which will be placed in the public domain very soon. To fulfil these commitments the spending on social sector has been gradually increased to Rs.1,37,674 crore which now stands at 37 per cent of the total plan outlay in 2010-11.  Another 25 per cent of the plan allocations are devoted to the development of rural infrastructure. With growth and the opportunities that it generates, we hope to further strengthen the process of inclusive development.\\n\\nEducation\\n\\n73.        The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 creates a framework for legal entitlements for all children in the age group of 6 to 14 years to education of good quality, based on principles of equity and\\nnon-discrimination. In recent years, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) has made significant contribution in improving enrolment and infrastructure for elementary education. About 98 per cent of habitations are now covered by primary schools. I propose to increase the plan allocation for school education from Rs.26,800 crore in 2009-10  to Rs.31,036 crore in 2010-11. In addition, States will have access to Rs.3,675 crore for elementary education under the Thirteenth Finance Commission grants for 2010-11.\\n\\nHealth\\n\\n74.        An Annual Health Survey to prepare the District Health Profile of all Districts shall be conducted in 2010-11. The findings of the Survey should be of immense benefit to major public health initiatives particularly the National Rural Health Mission, which has successfully addressed the gaps in the delivery of critical health services in rural areas.\\n\\n75.        I propose to increase the plan allocation for the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,  from Rs.19,534 crore to Rs.22,300 crore for 2010-11.\\n\\nFinancial Inclusion\\n\\n76.        To reach the benefits of banking services to the \\'Aam Aadmi\\', the Reserve Bank of India had set up a High Level Committee on the Lead Bank Scheme. After careful assessment of the recommendations of this Committee, and in further consultation with the RBI, it has been decided to provide appropriate Banking facilities to habitations having population in excess of 2000 by March, 2012. It is also proposed to extend insurance and other services to the targeted beneficiaries. These services will be provided using the Business Correspondent and other models with appropriate technology back up. By this arrangement, it is proposed to cover 60,000 habitations.\\n\\nFinancial Inclusion Fund (FIF) and the Financial Inclusion Technology Fund\\n\\n77.        In 2007-08 the Government had set up a Financial Inclusion Fund and a Financial Inclusion Technology Fund in NABARD, to reach banking services to the unbanked areas. To give momentum to the pace of financial inclusion, I propose an augmentation of Rs.100 crore for each of these funds, which shall be contributed by Government of India, RBI and NABARD.\\n\\nRural Development\\n\\n78.        In the words of Mahatma Gandhi \"Just as the universe is contained in the self, so is India contained in the villages\". For UPA Government, development of rural infrastructure remains a high priority area. For the year 2010-11, I propose to provide Rs.66,100 crore for Rural Development.\\n\\n79.        Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme has completed four years of implementation during which it has been extended to all districts covering more than 4.5 crore households. The allocation for NREGA has been stepped up to Rs.40,100 crore in 2010-11. Bharat Nirman has made a substantial contribution to the upgradation of rural infrastructure through its various programmes. For the year 2010-11, I propose to allocate an amount of Rs.48,000 crore for these programmes.\\n\\n80.        Indira Awas Yojana is a popular rural housing scheme for weaker sections. Taking note of the increase in the cost of construction, I propose to raise the unit cost under this scheme to Rs.45,000 in the plain areas and to Rs.48,500 in the hilly areas. For the year 2010-11, the allocation for this scheme is being increased to Rs.10,000 crore.\\n\\n81.        As a part of the strategy to bridge the infrastructure gap in backward districts of the country, the Backward Region Grant Fund has proved to be an effective instrument. I propose to enhance the allocation to this fund by 26 per cent from Rs.5,800 crore in 2009-10 to Rs.7,300 crore in 2010-11. I have also provided an additional central assistance of Rs.1,200 crore for drought mitigation in the Bundelkhand region in the Budget.\\n\\nUrban Development and Housing\\n\\n82.        \"Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana\" designed to provide employment opportunities in urban areas, has been strengthened with focus on community participation, skill development and self employment support structures. For the year 2010-11, I propose to increase the allocation for urban development by more than 75 per cent from Rs.3,060 crore to Rs.5,400 crore.  In addition, the allocation for Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation is also being raised from Rs.850 crore to Rs.1,000 crore in 2010-11.\\n\\n83.        While presenting the Union Budget for the year 2009-10, I had announced a Scheme of one per cent interest subvention on housing loans up to Rs.10 lakhs where the cost of the house does not exceed Rs.20 lakhs. I propose to extend this Scheme up to March 31, 2011. Accordingly, I propose to provide a sum of Rs.700 crore for this Scheme for the year 2010-11.\\n\\n84.        The Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) for slum dwellers and urban poor was announced last year to extend support to States that are willing to provide property rights to slum dwellers. This scheme is now ready to take off. I propose to allocate Rs.1,270 crore for 2010-11 as compared to Rs.150 crore last year. This marks an increase of over 700 per cent. The Government is efforts in the implementation of RAY would be to encourage the States to create a slum free India at the earliest.\\n\\nMicro, Small & Medium Enterprises\\n\\n85.        Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) contribute 8 per cent of the country is GDP, 45 per cent of the manufactured output and 40 per cent of our exports. They provide employment to about 6 crore persons through 2.6 crore enterprises. To resolve a number of issues which affect the growth of this sector, Prime Minister constituted a High-Level Task Force which held detailed discussions with all stake holders and drew up an agenda for action. A High Level Council on Micro and Small Enterprises will monitor the implementation of the recommendations and the agenda for action. I propose to raise the allocation for this sector from Rs.1,794 crore to Rs.2,400 crore for the year 2010-11.\\n\\n86.        A loan agreement for US $ 150 million has been signed between the Government of India and the Asian Development Bank on 22nd December, 2009 for implementing the comprehensive Khadi Reforms Programme. This programme will cover 300 selected Khadi institutions.\\n\\nMicro Finance\\n\\n87.        The programme for linking Self Help Groups (SHGs) with the banking system has emerged as the major micro-finance initiative in the country. It was re-designated as the \\'Micro-Finance Development and Equity Fund\\' in 2005-06 with a corpus of Rs.200 crore. The fund corpus is being doubled to Rs.400 crore in 2010-11.\\n\\nUnorganised Sector\\n\\nNational Social Security Fund for unorganised sector workers\\n\\n88.        Recognising the need for providing social security to the workers in the unorganised sector, and as a follow up to the Unorganised Sector Workers Social Security Act, 2008, it has been decided to set up a National Social Security Fund for unorganised sector workers with an initial allocation of Rs.1,000 crore. This fund will support schemes for weavers, toddy tappers, rickshaw pullers, bidi workers etc.\\n\\n89.        The Government had launched Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana on October 1, 2007 to provide health insurance cover to below poverty line workers and their families. It became operational on April 1, 2008 and so far more than 1 crore smart cards have been issued under this scheme. In view of the success of the scheme, it is now proposed to extend its benefits to all such Mahatma Gandhi NREGA beneficiaries who have worked for more than 15 days during the preceding financial year.\\n\\n90.        To encourage the people from the unorganised sector to voluntarily save for their retirement and to lower the cost of operations of the New Pension Scheme (NPS) for such subscribers, Government will contribute Rs.1,000 per year to each NPS account opened in the year 2010-11. This initiative, \"Swavalamban\" will be available for persons who join NPS, with a minimum contribution of Rs.1,000 and a maximum contribution of Rs.12,000 per annum during the financial year 2010-11. The scheme will be available for another three years. Accordingly, I am making an allocation of Rs.100 crore for the year 2010-11. It will benefit about 10 lakh NPS subscribers of the unorganised sector. The scheme will be managed by the interim Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority.\\n\\n91.        I also appeal to the State Governments to contribute a similar amount to the scheme and participate in providing social security to the vulnerable sections of the society.\\n\\nSkill development\\n\\n92.        Prime Minister is Council on National Skill Development has laid down the core governing principles for operating strategies for skill development. The Council has a mission of creating 50 crore skilled people by 2022. Of these, the target for the National Skill Development Corporation, which has started functioning from October, 2009, is 15 crore. It has completed a comprehensive skill gap study of 21 high growth sectors and approved three projects worth about Rs.45 crore to create 10 lakh skilled manpower at the rate of one lakh per annum. Other projects are in advanced stages of consideration.\\n\\n93.        It is proposed to launch an extensive skill development programme in the textile and garment sector by leveraging the strength of existing institutions and instruments of the Textile Ministry. The resources of the private sector will also be harnessed by incentivising training through an outcome - based approach. Through these instruments, the Ministry of Textiles has set an ambitious target of training 30 lakh persons over 5 years.\\n\\nSocial Welfare\\n\\n94.        I propose to step up the plan outlay for Women and Child Development by almost 50 per cent. Several new initiatives that were launched in 2009-10 are now ready for implementation. A mission for empowerment of women is being set up. The ICDS platform is being expanded for effective implementation of the Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Adolescent Girls.\\n\\n95.        To further improve female literacy rate, the Government has recast the earlier National Literacy Mission as a new programme \"Saakshar Bharat\". It was launched in September, 2009 with a target of 7 crore non-literate adults which includes 6 crore women.\\n\\n96.        A Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana to meet the specific needs of women farmers is being launched. I have provided Rs.100 crore for this initiative as a sub-component of the National Rural Livelihood Mission.\\n\\n97.        I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that I propose to enhance the plan outlay of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to Rs.4500 crore. This amounts to an increase of 80 per cent as compared to 2009-10. This will support the programmes being implemented for the target population groups covering the Scheduled Castes, Other Backward Classes, persons with disabilities, senior citizens and victims of alcoholism and substance abuse. With this enhancement, the Ministry will be able to revise rates of scholarship under its post-matric scholarship schemes for SCs and OBC students, which is long overdue.\\n\\n98.        The allocation will also assist in establishing an Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre for the benefit of the hearing impaired. District Disability Rehabilitation Centres are being set up in 50 additional districts along with two composite regional centres for persons with disabilities.\\n\\n99.        I also propose to raise the plan allocation for the Ministry of Minority Affairs from Rs.1,740 crore to Rs.2,600 crore for the year 2010-11. This marks an increase of nearly 50 per cent. I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that we are close to achieving the target of 15 per cent priority sector lending to minorities in the current year. This will be maintained for the next three years.\\n\\nSTRENGTHENING TRANSPARENCY & PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILTY\\n\\n100.      The UPA Government has made a serious attempt to create an environment that supports transparency and accountability in the working of the public institutions in the country. As Honourable Members are aware, a number of legislative and administrative measures have been taken in this regard.\\n\\nFinancial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission\\n\\n101.      Most of our legislations governing the financial sector are very old. Large number of amendments to these Acts made at different points of time has also increased ambiguity and complexity. The Government proposes to set up a Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission to rewrite and clean up the financial sector laws to bring them in line with the requirements of the sector.\\n\\nAdministrative Reforms Commission\\n\\n102.      The Administrative Reforms Commission constituted by the UPA Government in its first term has submitted 15 reports, of which 10 reports have been examined by the Government. Out of the 800 identified recommendations for implementation so far, 350 recommendations have been implemented and 450 are under implementation.\\n\\nUnique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)\\n\\n103.      In my last Budget Speech, I had announced the constitution of the Unique Identification Authority of India, its broad working principles and the timelines for delivery of the first UID numbers. I am happy to report that the Authority has been constituted and it will be able to meet its commitments of issuing the first set of UID numbers in the coming year. It would provide an effective platform for financial inclusion and targeted subsidy payments. Since the UIDAI will now get into the operational phase, I am allocating Rs.1,900 crore to the Authority for 2010-11.\\n\\nTechnology Advisory Group for Unique Projects (TAGUP)\\n\\n104.      An effective tax administration and financial governance system calls for creation of IT projects which are reliable, secure and efficient. IT projects like Tax Information Network, New Pension Scheme, National Treasury Management Agency, Expenditure Information Network, Goods and Service Tax, are in different stages of roll out. To look into various technological and systemic issues, I propose to set up a Technology Advisory Group for Unique Projects under the Chairmanship of Shri Nandan Nilekani.\\n\\nIndependent Evaluation Office (IEO)\\n\\n105.      The Government had announced the setting-up of an Independent Evaluation Office to undertake impartial and objective assessments of the various public programmes and improve the effectiveness of the public interventions.  It has been decided that it would be an independent entity under a Governing board chaired by the Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission. The IEO would evaluate the impact of flagship programmes and place the findings in the public domain. It would be funded by the Planning Commission.\\n\\nSymbol for Indian Rupee\\n\\n106.      In the ensuing year, we intend to formalise a symbol for the Indian Rupee, which reflects and captures the Indian ethos and culture. With this, Indian Rupee will join the select club of currencies such as the US Dollar, British Pound Sterling, Euro and Japanese Yen that have a clear distinguishing identity.\\n\\nSecurity and Justice\\n\\n107.      Secure borders and security of life and property fosters development. I propose to increase the allocation for Defence to Rs.1,47,344 crore. This would include Rs.60,000 crore for capital expenditure. Needless to say, any additional requirement for the security of the nation will be provided for.\\n\\n108.      In 2009-10, the overall internal security and law and order situation in the country remained largely under control. Several new measures were taken by the Government to strengthen the security apparatus of the country. These include operationalisation of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), establishment of four NSG Hubs, augmentation of the Intelligence Bureau and its Multi-Agency Centre.\\n\\n109.      There was decline in violence in Jammu and Kashmir in the year 2009. We have taken a number of confidence building measures. As one more such measure, Government proposes to recruit about 2,000 youth as constables in five Central Para Military Forces in the year 2010.\\n\\n110.      To address the development problems of the thirty three left wing extremism affected districts, a Task Force headed by the Cabinet Secretary was formed for promoting coordinated efforts across a range of development and security measures. It has been decided that Planning Commission will prepare an integrated action plan for the affected areas. Adequate funds will be made available to support the action plan. I appeal to the misguided elements to eschew violence and join the development process.\\n\\nNational Mission for Delivery of Justice and Legal Reforms\\n\\n111.      To provide timely delivery of justice to all, the Government has approved the setting up of the National Mission for Delivery of Justice and Legal Reforms. The objective of the mission is to help reduce legal backlog in courts from an average of 15 years at present to 3 years by 2012. It would also help in improving the legal environment for business. The Thirteenth Finance Commission has provided grants amounting to Rs.5,000 crore for the States to improve the delivery of justice, including strengthening of alternate dispute resolution mechanisms.\\n\\nBudget Estimates 2010-11\\n\\n            I now turn to the Budget Estimates for 2010-11.\\n\\n112.      The Gross Tax Receipts are estimated at Rs.7,46,651 crore. The Non Tax Revenue Receipts are estimated at Rs.1,48,118 crore. The net tax revenue to the Centre as well as the expenditure provisions in 2010-11 have been estimated with reference to the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission.\\n\\n113.      The total expenditure proposed in the Budget Estimates for 2010-11 is Rs.11,08,749 crore, which is an increase of 8.6 per cent over the total expenditure in BE 2009-10.  The Plan and Non Plan expenditures in BE 2010-11 are estimated at Rs.3,73,092 crore and Rs.7,35,657 crore, respectively. While there is a 15 per cent increase in Plan expenditure, the increase in Non Plan expenditure is only 6 per cent over the BE of previous year.  With this level of Plan expenditure, I am confident that the total Plan expenditure would be very close to 100 per cent of the expenditure envisaged in the Eleventh Five Year Plan.\\n\\n114.      Honourable Members will agree that fiscal policy has to be guided by the required framework for fiscal prudence. In the Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement presented along with Budget 2009-10, I had laid down a road map for fiscal deficit. I am happy to report that in keeping with my commitment, I have been able to present the Budget for 2010-11 with a fiscal deficit of 5.5 per cent. In the Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement being presented to the House today, along with other Budget documents, the rolling targets for fiscal deficit are pegged at 4.8 per cent and 4.1 per cent for 2011-12 and 2012-13, respectively. These projections improve upon the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission.\\n\\n115.      While presenting the Budget for 2009-10, I had expressed my concern about the high level of fiscal deficit.  I had also stated that the Government will address this issue in right earnest to come back to the path of fiscal consolidation at the earliest.  I am happy to report that against a fiscal deficit of 7.8 per cent in 2008-09, inclusive of oil and fertiliser bonds, the comparable fiscal deficit is 6.9 per cent as per the Revised Estimates for 2009-10.  Both these deficit figures are based on the revised GDP numbers published by the Central Statistical Organisation and include what were earlier referred to as below the line items. This marks an improvement of about one per cent in fiscal deficit during the current year.  I have made a conscious effort to avoid issuing bonds to oil and fertiliser companies.  I would like to continue with this practice of extending Government subsidy in cash, thereby bringing all subsidy related liabilities into our fiscal accounting.\\n\\n116.     The fiscal deficit of 5.5 per cent of GDP in 2010-11 works out to Rs.3,81,408 crore.  Taking into account the various other financing items for fiscal deficit, the actual net market borrowing of the Government in 2010-11 would be of the order of Rs.3,45,010 crore.  There will be enough space to meet the credit needs of the private sector.  The Government will plan the borrowing programme in consultation with the RBI.\\n\\n PART - B\\n\\nMadam Speaker,\\n\\n            I shall now present my tax proposals.\\n\\n117.     While formulating them, I have been guided by the principles of sound tax administration as embodied in the following words of Kautilya:\\n\\n\"Thus, a wise Collector General shall conduct the work of revenue collection.... in a manner that production and consumption should not be injuriously affected.... financial prosperity depends on public prosperity, abundance of harvest and prosperity of commerce among other things.\" \\n\\n118.     I had stated last year that tax reform is a process and not an event.  The process I had outlined in the area of direct taxes was to release a draft Direct Taxes Code along with a Discussion Paper.   In the area of indirect taxes, the reform initiative was the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax. I have presented the developments in both reform initiatives in Part \\'A\\' of my Speech.\\n\\n119.     We have continued on the path of computerisation in core areas of service delivery in the administration of direct taxes.  This will reduce the physical interface between taxpayers and tax administration and speed up procedures and processes. The Centralised Processing Centre at Bengaluru is now fully functional and is processing around 20,000 returns daily. This initiative will be taken forward by setting up two more Centres during the year.\\n\\n120.     As a part of Government is initiative to move towards citizen centric governance, the income tax department has introduced \"Sevottam\", a pilot project at Pune, Kochi and Chandigarh through Aayakar Seva Kendras.  These provide a single window system for registration of all applications including those for redressal of grievances as well as paper returns. This year the scheme will be extended to four more cities.\\n\\n121.     To achieve the roll-out of GST by April 2011, the indirect tax administrations at the Centre and the States need to revamp their internal work processes based on the use of Information Technology. I am happy to inform Honorable Members that project ACES - Automation of Central Excise & Service Tax, has already been rolled out throughout the country this year. This will impart greater transparency in tax administration and improve the delivery of taxpayer services. Similarly, a Mission Mode Project for computerisation of Commercial Taxes in States has been approved recently. With an outlay of Rs.1133 crore of which the Centre is share is Rs.800 crore, the project will lay the foundation for the launch of GST.\\n\\n122.     I mentioned last year, that the income tax return forms should be simple and user friendly. The income tax department is now ready to notify SARAL-II  form for individual salaried taxpayers for the coming assessment year. This form will enable individuals to enter relevant details in a simple format in only two pages.\\n\\n123.     To expeditiously resolve disputes with taxpayers I propose to expand the scope of cases which may be admitted by the Settlement Commission to include proceedings related to search and seizure cases pending for assessment. I also propose to expand the scope of Settlement Commission in respect of Central Excise and Customs so that certain categories of cases that hitherto fell outside its jurisdiction may be admitted.\\n\\n124.     Last year, amendments to the statute enabled Government to enter into tax treaties with specified territories besides sovereign states. We have commenced bi-lateral discussions to enhance the exchange of bank related and other information to effectively track tax evasion and identify undisclosed assets of resident Indians lying abroad. \\n\\nDirect Taxes\\n\\n            I shall now deal with direct taxes.\\n\\n125.     Last year I provided relief to individual taxpayers by enhancing the exemption limit for all taxpayers and withdrawing the surcharge on personal income tax. Taxpayers have responded positively to these concessions by contributing a higher level of taxes.  There is a persuasive case for further relief by broadening the current tax slabs which I propose as follows:\\n\\n            Income upto Rs.1.6 lakh                                                     Nil\\n\\n            Income above Rs.1.6 lakh and upto Rs.5 lakh                     10 per cent\\n\\n            Income above Rs.5 lakh and upto Rs.8 lakh                        20 per cent\\n\\n            Income above Rs.8 lakh                                                      30 per cent\\n\\n126.     The proposed broadening of tax slabs will provide substantial relief to a large number of taxpayers.\\n\\n127.     To promote savings as well as to ensure their utilisation for the thrust area of infrastructure, I propose to allow a deduction of an additional amount of Rs.20,000 for investment in long-term infrastructure bonds as notified by the Central Government.  This would be over and above the existing limit of Rs.1 lakh on tax savings.  I am sure that these reliefs will put more money in the hands of individual taxpayers for both consumption as well as saving.\\n\\n128.     Besides contributions to health insurance schemes which is currently allowed as a deduction under the Income-tax Act, I propose to allow contributions to the Central Government Health Scheme also as a deduction under the same provision. \\n\\n129.     Taking forward my initiative of phasing out surcharge, I propose to reduce the current surcharge of 10 per cent on domestic companies to 7.5 per cent.  At the same time, I propose to increase the rate of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) from the current rate of 15 per cent to 18 per cent of book profits. This will further promote inter-se equity among corporate taxpayers.\\n\\n130.     The President, in her address to the Parliament in June 2009, had declared this decade as the Decade of Innovation. Last year, I extended the scope of weighted deduction on expenditure incurred on in-house research and development (R&D) to all manufacturing businesses except for a small negative list.  To further encourage R&D across all sectors of the economy, I now propose to enhance the weighted deduction on expenditure incurred on in-house R&D from 150 per cent to 200 per cent. I also propose to enhance the weighted deduction on payments made to National Laboratories, research associations, colleges, universities and other institutions, for scientific research from 125 per cent to 175 per cent.\\n\\n131.     Currently, any payment made to an approved scientific research association is eligible for weighted deduction. The income of the approved scientific research association is exempt from tax. I propose that payments made to approved associations engaged in research in social sciences or statistical research would be allowed a weighted deduction of 125 per cent. The income of such approved research associations shall be exempt from tax.\\n\\n132.     In my Budget Speech last year, I stated that profit linked deductions are inherently inefficient and liable to misuse. To incentivise businesses in priority sectors, I introduced investment linked deduction as an alternative to profit linked deduction.  To give a boost to investment in the tourism sector which has high employment potential, I propose to extend the benefit of investment linked deduction under the Act to new hotels of two-star category and above anywhere in India.\\n\\n133.     To provide one time interim relief to the housing and real estate sector which was impacted by the global recession, I propose to allow pending projects to be completed within a period of five years instead of four years for claiming a deduction on their profits. I also propose to relax the norms for built-up area of shops and other commercial establishments in housing projects to enable basic facilities for their residents.\\n\\n134.     All businesses with a turnover exceeding Rs.40 lakh are currently required to have their accounts audited.  A similar provision also applies to all professions whose receipts exceed Rs.10 lakh.  I, as Finance Minister, had introduced these limits in my budget of 1984.  It is high time to reduce the compliance burden on small taxpayers.  I, therefore, propose to enhance these limits to Rs.60 lakh in the case of businesses and Rs.15 lakh in the case of professions.  \\n\\n135.     To facilitate the business operations of small taxpayers, I had extended the scope of presumptive taxation to all small businesses with a turnover of up to Rs.40 lakh.   To further reduce the compliance burden on small taxpayers, I now propose to enhance this limit to Rs.60 lakh. \\n\\n136.     The threshold limits of payments below which tax is not deductible at source have remained unchanged for a long time.  I propose to rationalise these thresholds. \\n\\n137.     Relaxing the current provisions on disallowance of expenditure, I propose to allow deduction of such expenditure, if tax has been deducted at any time during the financial year and paid before the due date of filing the return. This will allow most deductors additional time up to September of the next financial year.  At the same time, I propose to increase the interest charged on tax deducted but not deposited by the specified date, from 12 per cent to 18 per cent per annum. \\n\\n138.     Last year, I had provided for the taxation of the newly introduced Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) on the same lines as exists for a general partnership firm. To facilitate the conversion of small companies into LLPs, I propose that this will not be subject to capital gains tax.\\n\\n139.     Under the current provisions of the Act, \"the advancement of any other object of general public utility\" cannot be considered as \"charitable purpose\" if it involves  carrying on of any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business. I have received representations from many organisations seeking some relaxation in this restriction. I propose that this restriction would not be applicable if the receipts from such activities do not exceed Rs.10 lakh in the year. \\n\\n140.     My proposals on direct taxes are estimated to result in a revenue loss of Rs.26,000 crore for the year.\\n\\nIndirect Taxes\\n\\n141.     The major objectives that have guided me in the formulation of my proposals on indirect taxes are the need to achieve some degree of fiscal consolidation without impairing the recovery process and moving forward on the road to GST.\\n\\n142.     Unlike the time I presented the last Budget, symptoms of economic recovery are more widespread and clear-cut now. The three fiscal stimulus packages that the Government introduced in quick succession have helped the process of recovery significantly. The improvement in our economic performance encourages a course of fiscal correction even as the global situation warrants caution. Therefore, I propose to partially roll back the rate reduction in Central Excise duties and enhance the standard rate on all non-petroleum products from 8 per cent to 10 per cent ad valorem. The specific rates of duty applicable to portland cement and cement clinker are also being adjusted upwards proportionately. Similarly, the ad valorem component of excise duty on large cars, multi-utility vehicles and sports-utility vehicles which was reduced as part of the first stimulus package, is being increased by 2 percentage points to 22 per cent.\\n\\n143.     In the wake of spiralling petroleum prices, Government provided full exemption from basic customs duty to crude petroleum and proportionately reduced the basic duty on refined petroleum products in June, 2008. Compared to the international price of the Indian crude basket of US$ 112 per barrel at that time, the prices are much softer at present. In view of the pressing need to move back to a fiscal consolidation path, I propose to restore the basic duty of 5 per cent on crude petroleum; 7.5 per cent on diesel and petrol and 10 per cent on other refined products. I also propose to enhance the Central Excise duty on petrol and diesel by Re.1 per litre each.\\n\\n144.     Since I quit smoking many years ago, I would urge others to also follow suit, as smoking is injurious to health. To this end, I am making some structural changes in the excise duty on cigarettes, cigars and cigarillos coupled with some increase in rates. I also propose to enhance excise duty on all non-smoking tobacco such as scented tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco etc. In addition, I propose to introduce a compounded levy scheme for chewing tobacco and branded unmanufactured tobacco based on the capacity of pouch packing machines.\\n\\n145.     Let me now turn to some much-needed incentives in thrust areas for sustainable growth and development.\\n\\nAgriculture & Related Sectors\\n\\n146.     In supporting the strategy outlined for development of agriculture earlier in my speech, I propose to address a few key areas that call for focused attention. These are:\\n\\n(i)       A strong supply chain for perishable farm produce to reach consumption and processing centres promptly;\\n\\n(ii)      Infrastructure and technology to convert such produce into value-added products; and\\n\\n(iii)     Infusion of technology to augment agricultural production.\\n\\n147.     Similar attention needs to be paid to related sectors such as apiary, horticulture, dairy, poultry, meat, marine and aquaculture.\\n\\n148.     For achieving these objectives, I propose to provide:\\n\\nâ\\x80¢         project import status with a concessional import duty of 5 per cent for the setting up of mechanised handling systems and pallet racking systems in  amandis\\' or warehouses for food grains and sugar as well as full exemption from service tax for the installation and commissioning of such equipment.\\n\\nâ\\x80¢         project import status at a concessional customs duty of 5 per cent with full exemption from service tax to the initial setting up and expansion of\\n\\nÂ»      Cold storage, cold room including farm pre-coolers for preservation or storage of agriculture and related sectors  produce ; and\\n\\nÂ»      Processing units for such produce.\\n\\nâ\\x80¢        full exemption from customs duty to refrigeration units required for the manufacture of refrigerated vans or trucks.\\n\\n149.     I also propose to provide:\\n\\nâ\\x80¢         concessional customs duty of 5 per cent to specified agricultural machinery not manufactured in India;\\n\\nâ\\x80¢         central excise exemption to specified equipment for preservation, storage and processing of agriculture and related sectors and exemption from service tax to the storage and warehousing of their produce; and\\n\\nâ\\x80¢         full exemption from excise duty to trailers and semi-trailers used in agriculture.\\n\\n150.     Concessional import duty was provided to specified machinery for use in the plantation sector in the year 2003. This exemption is to lapse in July 2010.  The modernization of this labour-intensive sector is yet to reach the expected level. I propose therefore, to extend it up to March 31, 2011 along with a CVD exemption. I hope this will provide sufficient time for the sector to achieve the desired objective.\\n\\n151.     One of the prerequisites for agricultural productivity is access to good quality and disease-resistant seeds. I propose to exempt the testing and certification of agricultural seeds from service tax.\\n\\n152.     I also propose to exempt the transportation by road of cereals and pulses from service tax. Their transportation by rail would remain exempt.\\n\\n153.     I propose two measures under the Central Excise law to ease the cash flow position for small-scale manufacturers hard hit by the economic slowdown. First, they would be permitted to take full credit of Central Excise duty paid on capital goods in a single instalment in the year of their receipt. Secondly, they would be permitted to pay Central Excise duty on a quarterly, rather than monthly basis. These measures that come into effect on the April 1, 2010 should provide them considerable relief.\\n\\nEnvironment\\n\\n154.     Harnessing renewable energy sources to reduce dependence on fossil fuels is now recognised as a credible strategy for combating global warming and climate change. To build the corpus of the National Clean Energy Fund announced earlier, I propose to levy a clean energy cess on coal produced in India at a nominal rate of Rs.50 per tonne. This cess will also apply to imported coal.\\n\\n155.     In pursuance of Government is resolve to implement the National Solar Mission, I propose to provide a concessional customs duty of 5 per cent to machinery, instruments, equipment and appliances etc. required for the initial setting up of photovoltaic and solar thermal power generating units. I also propose to exempt them from Central Excise duty. Similarly, ground source heat pumps used to tap geo-thermal energy would be exempt from basic customs duty and special additional duty.\\n\\n156.     Wind energy has shown promising growth in the country in recent years. As a measure of further relief, I propose to exempt a few more specified inputs required for the manufacture of rotor blades for wind energy generators from Central Excise duty.\\n\\n157.     LED lights are staging a debut as a highly energy-efficient source of lighting for streets, homes and offices. Central Excise duty on these is being reduced from 8 per cent to 4 per cent at par with Compact Fluorescent Lamps.\\n\\n158.     Full exemption from Central Excise duty was provided to electric cars and vehicles that offer an eco-friendly alternative to petrol or diesel vehicles. The manufacturers of such vehicles have expressed difficulty in neutralising the duty paid on their inputs and components. I propose to remedy this by imposing a nominal duty of 4 per cent on such vehicles. I also propose to exempt some critical parts or sub-assemblies of such vehicles from basic customs duty and special additional duty subject to actual user condition. These parts would also enjoy a concessional CVD of 4 per cent.\\n\\n159.     The humble cycle rickshaw is now being acclaimed as an environment-friendly means of transport. CSIR has developed an innovative product called  isoleckshaw\\' to replace manually-operated rickshaws. It runs on batteries which are charged by solar power. I propose to provide a concessional excise duty of 4 per cent to this product. Its key parts and components are also being exempted from customs duty. \\n\\n160.     To encourage the use of bio-degradable materials, I propose to exempt the import of compostable polymer from basic customs duty.\\n\\nInfrastructure\\n\\n161.     Strengthening the public transport system is another means of reducing dependence on fossil fuels. I propose to grant project import status to \\'Monorail projects for urban transport\\' at a concessional basic duty of 5 per cent.          \\n\\n162.     Full exemption from import duty is available to specified machinery for road construction projects on the condition that the machinery shall not be sold or disposed of for a minimum period of five years. In view of representations that this leads to idling of machinery, I propose to allow resale of such machinery on payment of import duty at depreciated value. It is also being clarified that the importer is free to relocate such machinery to other eligible road construction projects.\\n\\n163.     With the subscriber base growing at 14 million per month, India is one of the fastest growing markets for mobile phone connections in the world. Domestic production of mobile phones is now picking up in view of exemptions from basic, CVD and special additional duties granted to their parts, components and accessories. To encourage the domestic manufacture of accessories, these exemptions are now being extended to parts of battery chargers and hands-free headphones. Also, the validity of the exemption from special additional duty is being extended till March 31, 2011.\\n\\nMedical Sector\\n\\n164.     Medical equipment, instruments and appliances are subjected to a very complex import duty regime based on several long lists that describe individual items. Multiple rates coupled with descriptions not aligned with tariff lines, result in disputes and at times prevent state-of-art equipment from getting the benefit of exemption. I propose to prescribe a uniform, concessional basic duty of 5 per cent, CVD of 4 per cent with full exemption from special additional duty on all medical equipment. A concessional basic duty of 5 per cent is being prescribed on parts and accessories for the manufacture of such equipment while they would be exempt from CVD and special additional duty. Full exemption currently available to medical equipment and devices such as assistive devices, rehabilitation aids etc. is being retained. The concession available to Government hospitals or hospitals set up under a statute is also being retained.\\n\\n165.     The manufacturers of orthopaedic implants have represented that their inputs attract a higher rate of duty than the finished product. I propose to exempt specified inputs for the manufacture of such implants from import duty.\\n\\nInfotainment\\n\\n166.     India is a nation of movie-goers. The film industry has been experiencing difficulties in importing digital masters of films for duplication or distribution loaded on electronic medium vis-a-vis  those imported on cinematographic film, owing to a differential customs duty structure. I propose to rationalise this by charging customs duty only on the value of the carrier medium. The same dispensation would apply to music and gaming software imported for duplication. In keeping with the tradition of Indian cinema, however, I shall provide a surprise ending. In all such cases the value representing the transfer of intellectual rights would be subjected to service tax.\\n\\n167.     Cable transmission of infotainment is undergoing a transformation with the adoption of digital technology. The multi-service operators need to invest in \"Digital Head End\" equipment. To enable this, I propose to provide project import status at a concessional customs duty of 5 per cent with full exemption from special additional duty to the initial setting up of such projects.\\n\\nPrecious Metals\\n\\n168.     The prices of precious metals continue to rise. Since the customs duty is levied on these at specific rates, I propose to index the rates as follows:\\n\\nâ\\x80¢         On gold and platinum from Rs.200 per 10 grams to Rs.300 per 10 grams.\\n\\nâ\\x80¢        On silver from Rs.1,000 per kg to Rs.1,500 per kg.\\n\\n169.     Gems and jewellery is a traditional item in our export basket. Rhodium - a precious metal used for polishing jewellery attracts a basic customs duty of 10 per cent. This is being reduced to 2 per cent.\\n\\n170.     To encourage domestic refining capacity for gold, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on gold ore and concentrates from 2 per cent ad valorem to a specific duty of Rs.140 per 10 grams of gold content with full exemption from special additional duty. Further, the excise duty on refined gold made from such ore or concentrate is being reduced from 8 per cent to a specific duty of Rs.280 per 10 grams.\\n\\nOther Proposals\\n\\n171.     Full exemption from import duty is available to specified inputs or raw materials required for the manufacture of sports goods which are assuming importance as an item of export. This is being expanded to cover a few more items.\\n\\n172.     In order to incentivise the domestic production of microwave ovens, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on one of its key components, namely magnetrons from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.\\n\\n173.     Presently, there is a value limit of Rs.1 lakh per annum on duty-free import of commercial samples as personal baggage. I propose to enhance this limit to Rs.3 lakh per annum.\\n\\n174.     Industry has represented that the exemption from special additional duty of 4 per cent based on refunds leads to substantial blockage of funds.  To ease this difficulty, I propose to provide an outright exemption from special additional duty to goods imported in a pre-packaged form for retail sale. This would also cover mobile phones, watches and ready-made garments even when they are not imported in pre-packaged form. The refund-based exemption is also being retained for cases not covered by the new dispensation.\\n\\n175.     Toy balloons are a source of joy to millions of children. To bring a smile to their mothers\\' faces, I propose to fully exempt them from Central Excise duty.\\n\\n176.     Some of the other relief measures that I propose are as under:\\n\\nâ\\x80¢         Reduction in basic customs duty on long pepper from 70 per cent to 30 per cent;\\n\\nâ\\x80¢         Reduction in basic customs duty on asafoetida from 30 per cent to 20 per cent;\\n\\nâ\\x80¢         Reduction in central excise duty on replaceable kits for household type water filters other than those based on RO technology to 4 per cent;\\n\\nâ\\x80¢         Reduction in central excise duty on corrugated boxes and cartons from 8 per cent to 4 per cent;\\n\\nâ\\x80¢         Reduction in central excise duty on latex rubber thread from 8 per cent to 4 per cent; and\\n\\nâ\\x80¢         Reduction in excise duty on goods covered under the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Act from 16 per cent to 10 per cent.\\n\\n177.     My proposals relating to customs and central excise are estimated to result in a net revenue gain of Rs.43,500 crore for the year.\\n\\nService Tax\\n\\n178.     The service sector contributes nearly 60 per cent of the GDP.   The service tax to GDP ratio however, is only around 1 per cent. This sector thus, has significant potential to augment revenue.\\n\\n179.     To bridge this gap, I had the option to raise the rate of service tax to 12 per cent as it was before I introduced the third stimulus package.  I am not resorting to this option to maintain the growth momentum and also to bring about a convergence in the rates of tax on goods and services.  I, therefore, propose to retain the rate of tax on services at 10 per cent to pave the way forward for GST.\\n\\n180.     I had another option - to bring all services under service tax. I am not opting for this either at this stage. I propose, however, to bring certain services, hitherto untaxed, within the purview of the service tax levy. These are being notified separately.\\n\\n181.     I am also proposing certain legislative changes to plug revenue leakages, to remove distortions and to clarify certain doubts that have arisen over a period of time. I do not want to waste the precious time of the House elaborating the details, as they are available in the Finance Bill and other Budget documents.\\n\\n182.     Export of services, especially in the area of Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing, generates substantial employment and brings in foreign exchange. I propose to ease the process of refund of accumulated credit to exporters of services by making necessary changes in the definition of export of services and procedures.\\n\\n183.     Accredited news agencies which provide news feed online attract service tax. Acknowledging the yeoman services of such news agencies in disseminating news, I propose to exempt such news agencies that meet certain criteria, from service tax.\\n\\n184.     My proposals relating to service tax are estimated to result in a net revenue gain of Rs.3,000 crore for the year.\\n\\n185.     Copies of notifications giving effect to the changes in customs, central excise and service tax will be laid on the Table of the House in due course.\\n\\n186.     My proposals on Direct Taxes are estimated to result in a revenue loss of Rs.26,000 crore for the year. Proposals relating to Indirect Taxes are estimated to result in a net revenue gain of Rs.46,500 crore for the year. Taking into account the concessions being given in my tax proposals and measures taken to mobilise additional resources, the net revenue gain is estimated to be Rs.20,500 crore for the year.\\n\\n187.     We have emerged from the global slowdown faster than any other nation. I did not hesitate in exercising my judgement on the course of action last year and I have no hesitation in my mind now. Our actions today will determine our tomorrow.\\n\\n188.     This Budget belongs to \\'Aam Aadmi\\'.  It belongs to the farmer, the agriculturist, the entrepreneur and the investor. The opportunity is great. The time is right. I have placed my faith in the hands of the people who, I know, can be depended upon to rise to any occasion in national interest. I have placed my faith in the collective conscience of the nation that can be touched to scale undreamt of heights in the coming years.\\n\\n189.     Madam Speaker, with these words I commend the Budget to the House.\\n\\n Link: https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/budget_archive/ub2010-11/bs/speecha.htm'"

            "Interim Budget 2014-2015 Speech of P. Chidambaram Minister of Finance February 17, 2014 Madam Speaker, I NT RO DU CT IO N I rise to present the Interim Budget for 2014-15. The Current Economic Situation 2. As I prepared to write this speech, I found that whether it is a regular Budget for the full year or an interim Budget, some things remain the same. For example, our goals are the same and the global context is the same. As I said last year, we are not unaffected by what happens in the rest of the world. Since September 2008, the state of the world economy has been the most decisive factor impacting the fortunes of every developing country. Hence, it is pertinent to say a few words on the global economy as well as on the global risks. 3. World economic growth was 3.9 percent in 2011, 3.1 percent in 2012 and 3.0 percent in 2013. Those numbers tell the story. Among Indias major trading partners, who are also the major sources of our foreign capital inflows, the United States has just recovered from a long recession; Japans economy is responding to the stimulus; the Eurozone, as a whole, is reporting a growth of 0.2 percent; and Chinas growth has slowed from 9.3 percent in 2011 to 7.7 percent in 2013. 4. The Global Risks 2014 report has mapped 31 global risks. Of highest concern are ten risks that include fiscal crisis, structurally high unemployment or underemployment, income disparity, governance failure, food crisis, and political and social instability. The challenges that we face are common to all emerging economies. 2012 and 2013 were years of turbulence. Only a handful of countries were able to keep their head above the water, and among them was India. I shall presently give you an account of how we navigated the Indian economy through this turbulent period. Challenges and Goals 5. Within days of my return to the Ministry of Finance, I had declared that our objectives were fiscal consolidation, price stability, self-sufficiency in food, reviving the growth cycle, enhancing investments, promoting manufacturing, encouraging exports, quickening the pace \fof implementation of projects, and finding practical solutions to certain stressed sectors such as petroleum, power, coal, highways and textiles. S TA TE O F T HE E CO NO MY The Twin Deficits and Inflation 6. Let me begin with the good news. The fiscal deficit for 2013-14 will be contained at 4.6 percent of G DP, well below the red line that I had drawn last year. More importantly, the Current Account Deficit, that threatened to exceed last years C AD of U SD 88 billion, will be contained at U SD 45 billion, and I am happy to inform the House that we expect to add about U SD 15 billion to the foreign exchange reserves by the end of the financial year. Analysts and rating agencies had acknowledged our efforts some months ago and no longer speak about a downgrade. I hope that domestic experts will now agree that the U PA Government meant what it said when it put fiscal stability at the top of the agenda. Going forward, I appeal to all political parties to join me in the pledge that we shall not  we shall never  do anything that will affect the stability of the foundations of Indias economy. 7. Last year, when I read the Budget speech, W PI headline inflation stood at 7.3 percent and core inflation at 4.2 percent. Through the year, inflation saw its ups and downs. At the end of January 2014, W PI inflation was 5.05 percent and core inflation 3.0 percent. Both the Government and the R BI have acted in tandem. While our efforts have not been in vain, there is still some distance to go. Food inflation is still the main worry, although it has declined sharply from a high of 13.6 percent to 6.2 percent. Agriculture 8. We are proud of the stellar performance of the agriculture sector. Foodgrain production in 2012-13 was 255.36 million tonnes and the estimate for the current year is 263 million tonnes. Estimates of production of sugarcane, cotton, pulses, oilseeds and quality seeds point to new records. Agriculture exports in 2012-13 stood at U SD 41 billion versus imports of U SD 20 billion. In 2013-14, agriculture exports are likely to cross U SD 45 billion. Agricultural credit is likely to touch `735,000 crore, exceeding the target of `700,000 crore. Agricultural G DP growth increased to 3.1 percent in the five year period of U PA-I and further to 4.0 percent in the first four years of U PA-I I. In the current year, agricultural G DP growth is estimated at 4.6 percent. Investment 9. Even after the slowdown, the savings rate was 31.3 percent in 2011-12 and 30.1 percent in 2012-13. The corresponding investment rate was 35.5 percent and 34.8 percent, respectively, indicating there was no steep decline in investment, except in mining and manufacturing. If the incremental capital output ratio (I CO R) had remained more or less the same, the outcome should have been a growth rate higher than the 6.7 percent and the 4.5 percent reported so far by the C SO for the two years, but that did not happen. It was obvious that projects were not achieving commercial operation date (C OD) and there were too many obstacles on the path of implementation. At a time when it appeared that a number of projects would fail because of the logjam, Government took the bold step to set up the Cabinet Committee on Investment and the Project Monitoring Group. Thanks to the swift decisions taken by them, by the end of January, 2014, the way was cleared for completing 296 projects with an estimated project cost of `660,000 crore. \fForeign Trade 10. Exports have recovered sharply, and the recovery must be seen in the context of growth of global trade declining from 6.1 percent in 2011 to 2.7 percent in 2013. Indias merchandise exports reached a level of U SD 300.4 billion in 2012-13 registering a negative growth of 1.8 percent over the previous year. Though 2013-14 began on a pessimistic note, I am happy to inform the House that the year will end with estimated merchandise exports of U SD 326 billion, indicating a growth rate of 6.3 percent. However, imports are down, and this does not augur well for either manufacturing or domestic trade. Our aim must be robust growth in both exports and imports, with trade in balance over a period of time. Manufacturing 11. Manufacturing is the Achilles heel of the Indian economy. The deceleration in investment in manufacturing is particularly worrying. Consequently, there is no uptick yet in manufacturing. The National Manufacturing Policy has set the goal of increasing the share of manufacturing in G DP to 25 percent and to create 100 million jobs over a decade. Eight National Investment and Manufacturing Zones (N IM Z) have been announced along the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor and nine projects have been approved by the D MI C Trust. Five N IM Zs outside D MI C have also been given in-principle approval. Three more corridors connecting Chennai and Bengaluru, Bengaluru and Mumbai, and Amritsar and Kolkata are under different stages of preparatory work. Additional capacities are being installed in major manufacturing industries such as steel, cement, refinery, power and electronics. Several measures have been taken to promote micro, small and medium enterprises including notifying a public procurement policy, establishing technology centres and common facility centres, and launching the Khadi mark. Infrastructure 12. We have given a big push to infrastructure and capacity addition in infrastructure industries. In 2012-13 and in the nine months of the current financial year, we have added 29,350 megawatts of power capacity, 3,928 kilometres of national highways, 39,144 kilometres of rural roads under P MG SY, 3,343 kilometres of new railway track, and 217.5 million tonnes of capacity per annum in our ports. Besides, 19 oil and gas blocks were given out for exploration and 7 new airports are under construction. We have also facilitated Infrastructure Debt Funds to provide take-out finance for infrastructure projects and ease the pressure on the banking system. Exchange Rate 13. Risks to capital flows were accentuated due to volatile global conditions and the indication, in May 2013, of a reduction in asset purchases by the U S Federal Reserve. The rupee came under pressure. Government, R BI and S EB I undertook a number of measures to facilitate capital inflows and stabilise the foreign exchange market. Among emerging economy currencies, the rupee was affected least when the actual reduction took place in December 2013 and January 2014. G DP Growth  Decline and Rise 14. Honble Members will recall that the slowdown began in 2011-12. In nine quarters, the G DP growth rate declined from 7.5 percent in Q1 of 2011-12 to 4.4 percent in Q1 of \f2013-14. Thanks to the numerous measures that I have narrated, I was confident that the decline will be arrested and the growth cycle will turn in the second quarter. I believe I have been vindicated. Growth in Q2 of 2013-14 has been placed at 4.8 percent and growth for the whole year has been estimated at 4.9 percent. This means that growth in Q3 and Q4 of 201314 will be at least 5.2 percent. 15. I can confidently assert that the economy is more stable today than what it was two years ago. The fiscal deficit is declining, the current account deficit has been contained, inflation has moderated, the quarterly growth rate is on the rise, the exchange rate is stable, exports have increased, and hundreds of projects have been unblocked. 16. Madam Speaker, all this is the result of hard work. I may add, among other mentors, my mother and Harvard taught me the value of hard work. U PAs Record of Growth 17. Over the last ten years, the U PA Governments have gently nudged India and Indians into accepting that growth is an imperative; that it must be made more inclusive and converted into development; and that the growth model, in order to be sustainable, must address other concerns such as environment, inter-generational equity, indebtedness, ownership and control of resources, financing etc. 18. The U PA Governments record on growth is unparalleled. 19. Ten years ago, we produced 213 million tonnes of food grains; today, we produce 263 million tonnes of food grains. Ten years ago, the installed power capacity was 112,700 M W; today, it is 234,600 M W. Ten years ago, coal production was 361 million tonnes per year; today, we produce 554 million tonnes per year. Ten years ago, there were 51,511 km of rural roads under P MG SY; today, we have 389,578 km. Ten years ago, the Central Governments expenditure on education was `10,145 crore; this year, we allocated `79,451 crore. Ten years ago, the Central Government spent `7,248 crore on health; this year, it will spend `36,322 crore. I could multiply the examples, but what I have given will suffice. 20. Madam Speaker, I reject the argument of policy paralysis. Just as there are business cycles, there is a cycle around the trend growth rate of an economy. Over a period of 33 years, the trend growth rate in India has been 6.2 percent. Average annual G DP growth during the period 1999-2004 was 5.9 percent, that is below the trend rate. In the next five year period 2004-2009, it was 8.4 percent and, in the period 2009-2014, going by the C SOs estimate, it will be 6.6 percent. U PA-I and U PA-I I have delivered above the trend growth rate. 21. Let history be the judge of the last ten years. R EP OR T C AR D O F 2013-14 22. I owe a duty to my colleagues to report on some of the major achievements in the current financial year that concerns the economy of the country and the welfare of the people. We are not simply looking back, we are actually looking forward, and therefore I shall also report on the initiatives that are being taken by my colleagues. Path-breaking Decisions 23. Government took several notable decisions including some that were described as courageous and long overdue. Sugar was fully decontrolled. A gradual correction of diesel \fprices was started. Railway fares were rationalised for the first time in a decade. Applications were invited for issue of new bank licences. D IS CO MS, mostly sick, are being restructured with generous Central assistance. Historic Legislations 24. 12.8 lakh land titles covering 18.80 lakh hectare were distributed under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act. 25. The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act was notified on 1.1.2014, finally putting to rest an oppressive colonial law of 1894. 26. The National Food Security Act was passed assuring foodgrain to 67 percent of the population. 27. The new Companies Act replaced a law of 1956 vintage. 28. The P FR DA Act was passed placing the New Pension System on a statutory basis and establishing a statutory regulator. Economic Initiatives 29. Centrally Sponsored Schemes were restructured into 66 programmes for greater synergy. Funds under these programmes will be released as Central assistance to State plans, thus giving States greater authority and responsibility. As a result, Central assistance to plans of States and Union Territories will rise substantially from `136,254 crore in B E 2013-14 to `338,562 crore in 2014-15. 30. Public sector enterprises will achieve a new record in capital expenditure of `257,641 crore in 2013-14. 31. About 50,000 M W of thermal and hydel power capacity is under construction after receiving all clearances and approvals. 78,000 M W of power capacity has been assured coal supply. 32. The F DI policy was liberalized to attract larger investments in telecommunication, pharmaceuticals, civil aviation, power trading exchanges and multi-brand retail. 33. Approval was granted to establish two semi-conductor wafer fab units that will be the bedrock of the electronics hardware industry. 34. The I T modernisation project of the Department of Posts, with an outlay of `4,909 crore, will be operational by 2015 in all 155,000 locations. 35. The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant Unit I achieved criticality and is generating 180 million units of power. The 500 M W prototype fast breeder reactor at Kalpakkam is nearing completion. Seven nuclear power reactors are under construction with the aim of achieving an installed capacity of 10,080 M W by the end of the Twelfth Plan. \f36. After exceeding the target and achieving 1,684 M W of grid connected solar power, the National Solar Mission entered the second phase on 1.4.2013. It is proposed to take up four ultra mega solar power projects each with a capacity of over 500 M W in 2014-15. 37. Ministry of M SM E will create the India Inclusive Innovation Fund to promote grassroot innovations with social returns to support enterprises in the M SM E sector. propose to make an initial contribution of `100 crore to the corpus of the Fund. Social Sector Initiatives 38. In order to promote entrepreneurship among the scheduled castes and to provide concessional finance to them, I FC I will set up a Venture Capital Fund for Scheduled Castes. I propose to provide an initial capital of `200 crore, which can be supplemented every year. 39. The restructured I CD S has been implemented in 400 districts and will be rolled out in the remaining districts from 1.4.2014. 40. Government has approved the National Agro-Forestry Policy 2014 which has multiple objectives including employment, productivity, conservation and adaptation. 41. A mechanism for marketing minor forest produce has been introduced, and the Budget has allocated `444.59 crore to continue the scheme in 2014-15. 42. A new plan scheme with an allocation of `100 crore has been approved to promote community radio stations. 43. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has delivered new technologies to the people: the J E vaccine, a diagnostic test for Thalassaemia, and a Magnivisualizer for detection of cervical cancer. Additional Central Assistance to some States 44. The North Eastern States, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand deserve special attention. In addition to funds allocated in the current year, I propose to release a sum of `1,200 crore as Additional Central Assistance to these States before the end of the year. Space 45. India joined a handful of countries when it launched the Mars Orbiter Mission. We now have the capability in launch vehicle technology, cryogenics, and navigation, meteorological and communication satellites, and are largely self-reliant. Several flight tests, navigational satellites and space missions are planned for 2014-15. Redeeming Our Promises 46. Last year, I had made three promises and I had asked Honble Members to keep before them the faces of the girl child, the young student, and the poor. To ensure the dignity and safety of women, I promised the Nirbhaya Fund and put `1000 crore into the Fund. So far, we have approved two proposals that will receive support from the Fund. In order to make it clear that the Fund will be a permanent fund, I intend to declare the grant of `1000 crore as non-lapsable. And in order to support more proposals, I propose to contribute to the Fund another sum of `1000 crore next year. 47. Secondly, I had promised an ambitious programme to skill millions of young men and women and had tasked the National Skill Development Corporation to implement the programme. The National Skill Certification and Monetary Reward Scheme was launched in \fAugust 2013 and has been widely hailed as a success. At last count, 24 Sector Skill Councils, 442 Training Partners and 17 Assessment Agencies had joined the programme. 204 job roles have been finalised. 168,043 youth had enrolled and 77,710 have completed their training. Honble Members will recall that I had set apart `1,000 crore for the scheme. The whole of that amount will be transferred to the N SD Trust and I propose to transfer another sum of `1,000 crore next year to enable the Trust to scale up the programme of N SD C rapidly. may add that N SD C actually complements the initiatives of several ministries which steer skill development programmes such as U DA AN in Jammu and Kashmir. 48. Thirdly, I had promised that the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme would be rolled out throughout the country. The scheme is barely a year old. Money is being transferred to beneficiaries under 27 identified schemes, including the National Social Assistance Programme (N SA P). A total of 54,20,114 transactions have been put through until 31.1.2014 and `628 crore has been transferred. Another sum of `3,370 crore has been transferred to 2.1 crore L PG beneficiaries. The latter scheme has been put on hold for the time being pending resolution of some difficulties that have been pointed out. However, let me reiterate that the Government remains fully committed to Aadhaar under which 57 crore unique numbers have been issued so far and to opening bank accounts for all Aadhaar holders in order to promote financial inclusion. Who needs Aadhaar? It is those who are at the bottom of the pyramid, the poor, the migrant workers, the homeless, and the oppressed who need Aadhaar, and we will ensure that they get Aadhaar. I have no doubt that in course of time even critics of Aadhaar will realise that Aadhaar is a tool of empowerment. O VE RV IE W O F T HE I NT ER IM B UD GE T Plan and Non-Plan Expenditure 49. I shall now give an overview of the interim Budget. In some years, we over-provide in the Budget. In those years savings are inevitable. Besides, if there is lower-than-expectedgrowth there will be lower-than-estimated-revenues as well. 2013-14 has been one such year. I am afraid, we will not be able to spend the budgeted plan expenditure, but non-plan expenditure will exceed the budget by a small amount. 50. In order to sustain the pace of plan expenditure, I have decided to keep plan expenditure in 2014-15 at the same level at which it was budgeted in 2013-14. I have provided `555,322 crore for plan expenditure. I am glad to inform the House that all the ministries/departments that run key flagship programmes of the U PA Government have been provided adequate funds. In all the following cases, I have provided in 2014-15 an amount equal to or higher than in the B E of 2013-14 and irrespective of the revised estimates for the year: Ministry of Minority Affairs .. ` 3,711 crore Ministry of Tribal Affairs .. ` 4,379 crore Ministry of Housing & Poverty Alleviation .. ` 6,000 crore Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment .. ` 6,730 crore Ministry of Panchayati Raj .. ` 7,000 crore Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation .. ` 15,260 crore Ministry of Women & Child Development .. ` 21,000 crore Ministry of Health & Family Welfare .. ` 33,725 crore \fMinistry of Human Resource Development .. ` 67,398 crore Ministry of Rural Development .. ` 82,202 crore Railways 51. My colleague, the Minister of Railways, presented the Railway Budget a few days ago. Budgetary support to Railways has been increased from `26,000 crore in B E 2013-14 to `29,000 crore in 2014-15. Railways need to mobilise huge resources through market borrowing and private public partnership (P PP) schemes. It is proposed to identify new instruments and new mechanisms to raise funds for railway projects. S C Sub-Plan and Tribal Sub-Plan, Gender Budget and Child Budget 52. Honble Members will be happy to know that I propose to allocate `48,638 crore to the scheduled caste sub-plan and `30,726 crore to the tribal sub-plan. They will also be happy to find that the gender budget has `97,533 crore and the child budget has `81,024 crore. 53. I am confident that there will be no cause for complaint. If there are any shortcomings, they can be addressed when the regular budget is presented. There is enough flexibility in the expenditure budget to make necessary changes in the allocations within the overall resource envelope. 54. Non-plan expenditure in 2014-15 is estimated at `12,07,892 crore. Of this, the expenditure on subsidies for food, fertilizer and fuel will be `246,397 crore. This is slightly more than the revised estimate of `245,452 crore in 2013-14. For fuel subsidy, I have provided `65,000 crore. We have, this year, absorbed the rollover of `45,000 crore from the fourth quarter of 2012-13 and we will rollover only `35,000 crore from the fourth quarter of this year into the next year. `115,000 crore has been allocated for food subsidy keeping in mind our Governments firm and irrevocable commitment to implement the National Food Security Act throughout the country. Defence 55. The allocation for defence has been enhanced by 10 percent from `203,672 crore in B E 2013-14 to `224,000 crore in 2014-15. One Rank One Pension 56. Honble Members are aware of the long standing demand of the Defence Services for One Rank One Pension (O RO P). It is an emotive issue, it has legal implications, and it has to be handled with great sensitivity. During the tenure of the U PA Governments, changes in the pension rules applicable to the defence services were notified on three occasions in 2006, 2010 and 2013. As a result, the gap between pre-2006 retirees and post-2006 retirees has been closed in four ranks (subject to some anomalies that are being addressed): Havildar, Naib Subedar, Subedar and Subedar Major. There is still a small gap in the ranks of Sepoy and Naik and a gap in the ranks of Major and above. We need a young fighting force, we need young jawans, and we need young officers. We also need to take care of those who served in the defence forces only for a limited number of years. Government has therefore decided to walk the last mile and close the gap for all retirees in all ranks. I am happy to announce that Government has accepted the principle of One Rank One Pension for the \fdefence forces. This decision will be implemented prospectively from the financial year 2014-15. The requirement for 2014-15 is estimated at `500 crore and, as an earnest of the U PA Governments commitment, I propose to transfer a sum of `500 crore to the Defence Pension Account in the current financial year itself. Central Armed Police Forces 57. A modernisation plan at a cost of `11,009 crore has been approved to strengthen the capacity of Central Armed Police Forces and to provide them state-of-the-art equipment and technology. Funds have been provided in the current financial year and for the next year. F IN AN CI AL S EC TO R Banking 58. Honble Members, the announcements that I made concerning the financial sector in the Budget speech of February 2013 have been, or are being, implemented. In 2014-15, I propose to provide `11,200 crore for capital infusion in public sector banks. They have opened 5,207 branches so far, against the target of 8,023 branches, and are near the goal of installing an A TM at every branch. The Bharatiya Mahila Bank was inaugurated on 19.11.2013. `6,000 crore was provided to the Rural Housing Fund and `2,000 crore to the Urban Housing Fund. 59. Banks are under strain owing to rising non-performing assets. Bankers have assured me that as the economy turns they will be able to contain the N PAs, recover more loans, and build healthier balance sheets. 60. Meanwhile, I cannot fail to acknowledge the yeomen service rendered by our banks in reaching Governments policies and programmes to the people. This year, banks will exceed the target of `700,000 crore of agricultural credit. I am therefore encouraged to set a target of `800,000 crore for 2014-15. Honble Members will recall that an interest subvention scheme was introduced in 2006-07. There is a subvention of 2 percent and an incentive of 3 percent for prompt payment, thus reducing the effective rate of interest on farm loans to 4 percent. So far, `23,924 crore has been released under the scheme. I propose to continue the scheme in 2014-15. Credit to Minority Communities 61. Ten years ago, the minorities had 14,15,000 bank accounts in 121 districts of India where there is a concentration of minorities. At the end of March, 2013, they had 43,52,000 accounts and the volume of lending had soared from `4,000 crore to `66,500 crore. Loans to minority communities in the whole country stood at `211,451 crore at the end of December 2013. Self Help Groups 62. Ten years ago, only 9,71,182 women Self-Help Groups had been credit linked to banks. At the end of December 2013, 41,16,000 women S HGs had been provided credit and the outstanding amount of credit was `36,893 crore. \fEducation Loans 63. Ten years ago, only a few thousand students  mostly the well-connected  got education loans. At the end of December 2013, public sector banks had 25,70,254 student loan accounts and the amount outstanding was `57,700 crore. 64. Honble Members will recall that my predecessor, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, had, in the Budget of 2009-10, introduced the Central Scheme for Interest Subsidy (C SI S) in respect of education loans disbursed after 1.4.2009 under which Government took over the burden of interest for the duration of the period of study and a little beyond. The scheme brought great cheer to student-borrowers and their families. However, I have noticed a sense of discrimination among students who had borrowed before 31.3.2009, struggled to pay interest during the period of study, and continued to service the loans afterwards. I think they deserve some relief. I therefore propose a moratorium period for all education loans taken up to 31.3.2009 and outstanding on 31.12.2013. Government will take over the liability for outstanding interest as on 31.12.2013, but the borrower would have to pay interest for the period after 1.1.2014. It is estimated that nearly 9 lakh student borrowers will benefit to the tune of approximately `2,600 crore. I intend to provide the funds in the current financial year itself. Accordingly, a sum of `2,600 crore will be transferred to the Canara Bank, the designated C SI S banker. Details of the scheme will be announced shortly. Insurance 65. This year, Life Insurance Corporation has opened 1,252 offices and the four public sector general insurance companies have opened 1,849 offices in towns with a population of 10,000 or more to serve peri-urban and rural areas. They are moving steadily to achieve the goals set for them. Financial Markets 66. A number of steps have been envisaged to deepen the Indian financial markets. Among them are  To comprehensively revamp the A DR/G DR scheme and enlarge the scope of Depository Receipts;  To liberalise the rupee-denominated corporate bond market;  To deepen and strengthen the currency derivatives market to enable Indian companies to fully hedge against foreign currency risks;  To create one record for all financial assets of every individual;  To enable smoother clearing and settlement for international investors looking to invest in Indian bonds. Commodity Derivatives Market 67. Honble Members will recall the payment crisis in the National Spot Exchange Limited (N SE L). Following the transfer of the subject to the Ministry of Finance, swift action was taken to sequester N SE L and to ensure there was no spill over of the crisis to the other regulated segments of the financial market. I propose to amend the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act to strengthen the regulatory framework of the commodity derivatives market. \fKey Pending Bills 68. I regret to record my disappointment that the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill and the Securities Laws (Amendment) Bill have not been passed by Parliament for reasons that have nothing to do with the merits of the Bills. Public Debt Management Agency 69. Pursuant to the announcement in the Budget speech of 2011-12, Government is ready with the Public Debt Management Agency Bill. Following precedent, it is proposed to establish a non-statutory P DM A that can begin work in 2014-15. A V IS IO N F OR T HE F UT UR E 70. Madam Speaker, I now wish to look forward and outline a vision for the future. 71. I wonder how many have noted the fact that Indias economy, in terms of the size of its G DP, is the 11th largest in the world. There are great things in store. There is a well-argued view that in the next three decades Indias nominal G DP will take the country to the third rank after the U S and China. Just as the fortunes of the developed countries affect the emerging economies today, the fortunes of China and India will, in the future, have a significant impact on the rest of the world. We therefore owe a responsibility not only to ourselves but to the whole world to keep our economy in robust health. 72. The U PA Government has a clear line of sight to the goals that we have set for ourselves. I have broken down the steps toward those goals into tasks that must be undertaken by the Government of the day. I crave your leave to identify ten such tasks: i. Fiscal Consolidation: We must achieve the target of fiscal deficit of 3 percent of G DP by 2016-17, and remain below that level always. ii. Current Account Deficit: Since we will run a Current Account Deficit every year for some more years, it can be financed only by foreign investment, whether it is F DI or F II or E CB or any other kind of foreign inflow. Hence, there is no room for any aversion to foreign investment. iii. Price Stability and Growth: In a developing economy we must accept that when our aim is high growth there will be a moderate level of inflation. R BI must strike a balance between price stability and growth while formulating monetary policy. iv. Financial Sector Reforms: The recommendations of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission that require no change in legislation must be implemented immediately and, for the other recommendations, we must draw a timetable for passing legislation. v. Infrastructure: We must rebuild our infrastructure and add a huge quantity of new infrastructure. Every proven model must be adopted and the P PP model must be more widely used. New financing structures must be created for long term funds and pooling of investments. vi. Manufacturing: We must focus on manufacturing and especially on manufacturing for export. I propose that all taxes, Central and State, that go into an exported product should be waived or rebated. I also propose that there \fshould be a minimum tariff protection so that there is an incentive to manufacture goods in India rather than import them into India. vii. Subsidies: Given the limited resources, and the many claims on the resources, we must choose the subsidies that are absolutely necessary and give them only to the absolutely deserving. viii. Urbanisation: Our cities will become ungovernable, and perhaps unliveable, if we do not address the decay in our cities. Cities have wealth, cities also create wealth. That wealth should be tapped for resources to rebuild the cities with a new model of governance. ix. Skill Development: Skill development must rank alongside secondary education, university education, total sanitation and universal health care in the priorities of the Government. x. Sharing responsibility between States and Centre: States have the fiscal space to bear a reasonable proportion of the financial costs of implementing flagship programmes and must willingly do so, so that the Central Government can allocate more resources for subjects such as defence, railways, national highways and telecommunications that are its exclusive responsibility. R EV EN UE S G ST and D TC 73. Revenues are of paramount importance. The best source of revenue is taxes and for that we need modern tax laws. I am disappointed that we have not yet been able to introduce G ST. I leave it to you to answer the question, who blocked the G ST when an agreement on the game-changing tax reform was around the corner? We have also got ready a Direct Taxes Code that will serve us for at least the next twenty years. I intend to place it on the website for a public discussion without partisanship or acrimony. I appeal to all political parties to resolve to pass the G ST laws and the D TC in 2014-15. Funding Scientific Research 74. Our Government has passionately espoused the cause of science, promoted scientific research, and supported scientific applications and inventions. The Income-tax Act allows deductions for expenditure on scientific research, but it is limited to direct funding. We have reflected on a new approach to funding scientific research. I therefore propose to set up a Research Funding Organisation that will fund research projects selected through a competitive process. Contributions to that organisation will be eligible for tax benefits. This will require legislative changes which can be introduced at the time of the regular Budget. Off-shore Accounts 75. There has been much debate on illegal off-shore accounts held by Indians. Investigations into such accounts were launched in 2011. Despite several hurdles in obtaining evidence from the countries concerned, the Government has succeeded, through alternative methods and special efforts, in obtaining information in 67 cases and action is underway to determine the tax liability as well as impose penalty. Prosecutions for wilful tax evasion have been launched in 17 other cases. More enquiries have been initiated into accounts reportedly held by Indian entities in no tax or low tax jurisdictions. \fChanges in Tax Rates 76. In keeping with the conventions, I do not propose to make any announcements regarding changes to the tax laws. However, the current economic situation demands some interventions that cannot wait for the regular Budget. In particular, the manufacturing sector needs an immediate boost. Hence, I propose the following changes in some indirect tax rates: (i) To stimulate growth in the capital goods and consumer non-durables, I propose to reduce the excise duty from 12 percent to 10 percent on all goods falling under chapter 84 and chapter 85 of the Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act for the period up to 30.6.2014. The rates can be reviewed at the time of the regular Budget. (ii) To give relief to the automobile industry which is registering unprecedented negative growth, I propose to reduce the excise duty as follows for the period up to 30.6.2014: Small cars, motor cycles, scooters and commercial vehicles } from 12% to 8% S UVs } from 30% to 24% Large and mid-segment cars } from 27/24% to 24/20% Consequently, I propose to make appropriate reductions in the excise duty on chassis and trailers. The rates can be reviewed at the time of the regular Budget. (iii) To encourage domestic production of mobile handsets (which has declined) and reduce the dependence on imports (which have increased), I propose to restructure the excise duties for all categories of mobile handsets. The rates will be 6 percent with C EN VA T credit or 1 percent without C EN VA T credit. (iv) To encourage domestic production of soaps and oleo chemicals, I propose to rationalise the customs duty structure on non-edible grade industrial oils and its fractions, fatty acids and fatty alcohols at 7.5 percent. (v) To encourage domestic production of specified road construction machinery, I propose to withdraw the exemption from C VD on similar imported machinery. (vi) To encourage indigenous production of security paper for printing currency notes, I propose to provide a concessional customs duty of 5 percent on capital goods imported by the Bank Note Paper Mill India Private Limited. 77. I also propose to give relief from service tax in two cases. (i) By virtue of the definition of agricultural produce in Finance Act 2012, read with the Negative List, storage or warehousing of paddy was excluded from the levy of service tax. Rice was not. The distinction is somewhat artificial. Hence, I propose to exempt loading, unloading, packing, storage and warehousing of rice from service tax. (ii) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has requested that services provided by cord blood banks are also healthcare services and should be exempt from service tax. I propose to accept the request. Notifications in respect of the above changes will be issued today. \fB UD GE T E ST IM AT ES 78. I shall now present the Budget Estimates for 2014-15. 79. The current financial year will end on a satisfactory note with the fiscal deficit at 4.6 percent (below the red line of 4.8 percent) and the revenue deficit at 3.3 percent. 80. Emboldened by the progress made, I have budgeted for receipts and expenditure in 2014-15 that will leave a fiscal deficit of 4.1 percent, which will be below the target set by the new fiscal consolidation path. Revenue deficit is estimated at 3.0 percent. 81. The estimate of plan expenditure is `555,322 crore. Non-plan expenditure is estimated at `12,07,892 crore. Conclusion 82. Madam Speaker, Jean Drèze and Amartya Sen have pointed out that India was the first non-Western country  and also the first poor country in the world  to commit itself to a resolutely democratic way of governance. Democracy acknowledges diversity, respects dissent, encourages debate, and decides through a government of elected representatives. Neither populism nor majoritarianism nor individualism is an alternative way of governance. 83. Our way of governance has not come in the way of lifting 140 million people out of poverty in the last ten years. That is the greatest achievement of the U PA Governments, and we are proud of the achievement. 84. In the ten years that I have been in the North Block, I have seen the best of times and difficult times. Never did I lose faith in Jawaharlal Nehrus idea of India that, in the words of Sunil Khilnani, sought to coordinate within the form of a modern state a variety of values: democracy, religious tolerance, economic development and cultural pluralism. It is with that faith that I shall remain on the bridge until the day when, I am sure, the people of India will entrust the responsibility to a hand that will hold the sceptre swayed with equity. Let me sign off with the couplet from the sage, Thiruvalluvar: Vel Anru Venri Tharuvathu Mannavan Kol Athuvoom Kodaathu Enin. (Not the spear but sceptre swayed with equity Alone gives the ruler victory.) 85. Madam Speaker, with these words I commend the Interim Budget to the House.\n"
